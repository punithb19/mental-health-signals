My own worst enemy was always myselfI ve been told how scary I am when I get angry and how broken I look when I m sad The anger and sadness have both dropped away now and all that s left is a numbness and a sense of singular purpose to escape No one took my first attempt seriously at the age of twelve despite my reason being I wanted to die I put a gun in my mouth but couldn t pull the trigger at age eighteen I knew something was horribly wrong before I got my autoimmune diagnosis for three years before I did anything despite leaking blood on a daily basis and even that was at someone else s insistence I stopped taking the highway to work because the idea of yanking the wheel over and smashing the car was a daily draw Had a complete breakdown at one job which led to my firing seven months to the day from my return Nearly walked out on the subway tracks to put a foot onto the third rail More than once I m past middle age lost my job I ve been fighting with insurance companies for a month to try to get the medication that keeps me alive I gave up Wednesday I m done I ve fought long and hard and I simply don t have it in me any more,"Cause of Distress, Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Progress Update",medium

 also my fiancÃ©s family is wonderful they in no part make me feel any anxiety or stress and are incredibly understanding 
 i am hopefully seeing a therapist this week as well as my primary care doctor to see what to do i suffer from high blood pressure as well which introduces another scary factor into the anxiety cocktail iâ€™m facing i take atenolol beta blocker and amlodopine daily which is actually supposed to help the anxiety however i think iâ€™ve just soared into the next level recently 
 any tips and tricks are appreciated i have an oura ring to track my stress but sometimes feel like i get so wrapped up in the data i stress myself out more

The time I almost got fired for pretending Garfield s favorite food was Spaghetti I originally wrote this in the comments of this post https www reddit com r confessions comments jwulcn anytime garfield comes up in conversation i felt it deserved to be posted properly i used to work at an ice cream shop near a plaza and some docks my boss was from communist romania he loved to remind us he had come here and established his own business i was one of maybe six employees and was fifteen at the time the work was pretty awful the actual shop part was a breeze but once a week we had to unload a wheeler full of frozen duffle bags full of ice cream boxes only half of which had handles id guess the bags were maybe pounds each that s awful already considering im a teenage girl but the truck was also like and it was usually like outside so id go into the truck throw the bags into the back of a pickup and then get out and sit in the back while the driver took us about minutes away to the walk in freezer during that drive i d sweat but once we got to the freezer the sweat would freeze then melt on the way back then freeze in the truck then melt again i used to have icesicles coming off of my hat and ponytail the whole truck would take maybe hours with four of us we didnt always get four and we had to empty the bags and sort the boxes in the freezer with almost no light so yeah maybe the worst job ive ever had To be clear I definitely don t hate the guy man was one of the friendliest people I ve ever met but maybe he shouldn t have hired a teenager to help handle the really difficult parts of his business I mention all of this because context is very important here He used to sit in the back for the first half of the day doing computer shit criticizing us throwing things if we cursed near customers and during his lunch break he would eat a ham and mustard sandwich while reading the comic strip section in the newspaper and laughing like santa claus but his mouth was ALWAYS full after he left and we went into the office to grab the keys you could see the wall he faced that had pictures of his family on it just covered in yellow mustard spittle like a shotgun spread anyway if one of us walked past him during that window to take the trash out or go on break or something he would always pull us aside and point at it laughing usually saying the punchline that got him There was of course one glorious exception BAAHAHA THE GARFIELD CAT He NEVER pointed out the punchline I think he just liked how he looked or something He did say HE HATES ZE MONDAYS sometimes too but mostly he d just roar out GARFIELD CAT and lose his mind choking on his sandwich sometimes Anyway this time I had JUST gotten in from like six hours of grueling ice cream truck freezer dufflebag HELL and as soon as I walked through the door he GRABBED my shirt and pulled me down laughing splattering mustard in my face laughing about garfield Now at this point I was just about fucking done His breath stank I was sweating and shivering not to mention this was all for minimum wage I had done the garfield bit twice before but not so die hard I d fuck with them for a minute or two then burst out laughing This time it was WAR I burst out laughing too instantly winning me an oscar and returned volley AHAHAA the SPAGHETTI CAT He stopped in PLACE No more laughing no more mustard He turned to me genuinely shocked at my misunderstanding You not mean the Lasagna he asked I shook my head looking at him quizzically instantly snagging my second oscar No no Garfield s favorite food is definitely spaghetti He grumbled about it searched the paper but that strip didn t mention it The next day I came into work though he was VERY quick to grab me again pretty much YANK me over to the desk and point out that TODAY S paper had a picture of the lasagna that Garfield was eating unfortunately for him it did not have the word lasagna written I claimed it was spaghetti he was very visibly frustrated but then we had a rush and he let me go The next day same deal but this time it had it written I had the balls to just laugh and say Wow this is a really elaborate joke you re pulling on me and he went BALLISTIC NO the PAPER SAYS LAH ZAGG NAH NOT SPAH GET EE He was very adamant about it for the rest of the shift not even caring that customers were there but I acted TOTALLY unfazed by it I d scoop their cones and checkout all while he trailed me like HOW CAN YOU THINK THE GARFIELD CAT EAT SPAGHETTI THERE IS NO NOODLE and I d reply with some total BS and confuse frustrate him even more I finally broke near the end of the day HE STAYED LONGER TO TALK ABOUT THIS WITH ME when he whispered to himself Does poor girl not know difference Her mother I just couldn t take it I laughed for like two seconds but he caught on I think his phrasing was YOU YOU HAVE BEEN A TRICKING ME and he started bellowing about it again We both fuckin cried about that for maybe an hour and we closed early Before I left he said I was Very funny girl but I was lucky he found out it was a joke because he was losing sleep over it and he couldn t handle working with me I laughed again and we said goodbye I got a new job a few months later with much better pay and less manual labor and he bought me some spaghetti from the pizzeria across the street as a parting gift on my last shift labeled lasagna Jesus that s a long post but it s one of my favorite stories glad to have it catalogued somewhere Hope you guys enjoyed reading haha,"Cause of Distress, Mental Distress, Positive

One day I truly feel so in love with someone I want to do everything for them. The next day WITHOUT ANY TRIGGERS I hate them, don’t want them to be happy etc. I’m aware that I split when I’m triggered but this is different than splitting. Same goes with everything else in my life. Standards, morals, etc. It’s just like some hours of the day I have these overwhelming lovey dovey euphoric feelings and then a minute later I’m in agonizing pain, for no reason at all. What does this mean? I feel like I can do all the DBT in the world but it would never fix this part of me.

I am not sure what I expect out of sharing this Anytime I have reached out in a moment of deep despair to our community through the various subs all the beautiful people rush forward and try to help which I appreciate immensely However even if I am alleviated of the pain of my existential issues the issues themselves remain So I have found myself in a moment with less emotional intensity and may be better equipped to rationally examine this I have been VERY careful not to discuss this with most people because I fear disrupting their foundation upon which all the good things rest ideals dreams goals etc If I am to progress past this low point in my life I absolutely need to approach the issue from all angles here I am not great with structuring these things sometimes so please forgive me Of all the lingering elements from my past that still bother me the foremost amongst these is my endless source of self loathing and my issues being invested in this world in this life While discovering I was trans finally gave me what I needed for decades the knowledge of what I am everyone is aware that it can get worse before it gets better I rode most of these waves rather well I believe considering all that has to be unpacked disposed off and the healing that must occur But I think these two things I mentioned keep coming back to bother me How can I stop hating myself if I even should I have felt this and fed this since middle school about twenty years ago While life has occasionally distracted me from this omnipresent fact this is part of the poison that seeps into the well I have tried creating positive feedback loops with proper self talk and productivity revising my mental narrative and outright ignoring those thoughts and feelings and focusing elsewhere I have seen therapists and I am familiar with their tools But this is DEEP and implacable Next as with many of us on this path I managed to survive by escaping this world For me that meant graphic novels standard novels gaming and eventually substances Some people think I am strong but I only managed to endure by being mindful of putting one foot in front of the other while dreaming of other worlds of another life Now even when I try I struggle to engage with this life And by that I mean to really feel invested to DESIRE to work on something and improve something to have the hope of any success I have always felt like I have been a person that just was not there Warning for others that are older harsh thoughts for my age ahead All of this is exacerbated by getting older Its a feeling like waking up from a coma in a house that is literally falling apart around me Having to struggle to get my life on track fighting with the momentum it has taken on and maintaining without any hope of actually improving really my body and appearance is just devastating I was better of not caring at all Who is out there for me What is there at all at this point Acceptance Surrender Just making it through and surviving Those sound like compensation prizes like an achievement worth little to no value I have focused on goals ran upon the hedonic treadmill and behind every thought is why My moment basking in the warmth of my trans epiphany has faded and I am left with the harsh reality of picking up whatever pieces I can find and seeing their value And for me I see none I am weak I am afraid and I am a burden to my family and friends I have broken hearts when I was lost and made so many mistakes I just want rest please I just want to not be me anymore I do not think kind sentiments will do much anymore Thank you for reading Lilith,"Cause of Distress, Mental Distress, Positive Coping",medium

My friend is slowly getting worse and has made threats to kill himself I m not sure what steps to take Hi everyone Best wishes to everyone and I m so sorry that anyone has to go through what you all have gone through I myself have thankfully been able to get out of my own depression and am now in a better place My friend however just seems to be getting worse He s only Just turned a few months ago actually Lately he s been making threats I wouldn t call them threats but the word that I m looking for escapes me and saying things like if my dad s gun case wasn t locked I don t know what I would do and things of that nature very very openly to me He said once that he might do it soon if things don t get better I ask him why and he says I just can t deal with it anymore He s been very reckless lately When he was younger at around or so he got his hands on some strong prescription pain killers and benzodiazepines which he stole from family and his parents Ever since then he s loved the idea of getting more He hasn t tried any pharmaceutical opiates in years but I guess for some people the feeling just can t ever be forgotten Then he found out about Kratom Kratom is great and for responsible users it s a godsend I use it myself every once in a while and it s fantastic Great for pain and sleep Ever since he got some he s started abusing it It started out as something he did every once in a while but within a week he had said f it and started using it every time something went wrong in his life He uses it as a crutch if you will One day I passively mentioned phenibut and then he suddenly ordered some I deeply regret that He abuses this now too Phenibut is a nootropic that has anti anxiety characteristics It s notorious for its rebound anxiety and withdrawal after being abused I honestly don t know how much he s used of Phenibut but he s had some pretty bad anxiety now that he says he s off of it Now he has been talking about getting some strong pharmaceutical opiates again I tried to tell him that that road might not lead him to happiness and that he could prossibly be worse in the long run but he just retorted with isn t the goal of life to have as much fun as possible and be as happy as possible I tried to reason with him and say no the goal is the be fully happy with the situation you re in without the use of substances I may have been wrong it s fine to seek help from substances But he hasn t seen a psychiatrist or anything so at this point he s self medicating and poorly at that He s always struggled with depersonalization derealization as well And he says it s been getting worse In my opinion I think the substances he s been testing with may be making him worse in the long run He doesn t seem to want help though There s other stuff that I won t list here one of which I think could possibly be messing up his brain s dopamine system but he doesn t even want to try stopping it I mean if it could help and you re pretty desparate why not But I m not him and he s probably in a completely different headspace than I m in Also he has a LOT of anxiety stemming from the fact that he ll need to be going to college soon and honestly I feel like he s still very much a kid inside His parents gave him the option of waiting one year but he saw his other friend just decide not to go to college after getting a well paying job during his gap year Reading through this post I m pretty sure that I m not looking at all of this from the right perspective It s been a long time since I was in a situation similar to his so I m having trouble putting the shoes on the other foot so I apologize,"Cause of Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Mental Distress, Seeking Help",medium

I m having a really hard time convincing myself to keep going I ll try to keep this brief About years ago I decided to try and turn my life around I went back to school and moved to another state to return to school While there I lost lbs decided to pursue a professional degree i e like an MD made some wonderful friends and had a couple of very meaningful relationships Fast forward to the end of my time there and I had been accepted into the top schools in the country and was just finishing up my studies I decided to end my relationship of years with a girl for both good and bad reasons but ultimately I ve come to regret that decision Without going into details I have a hard time forming connections with others so being able to get that close with someone is something very special I decided to go to the school closest to my home because I was feeling homesick at the time due to being away for nearly years When I arrived I was lonely and a little out of shape but excited to start school Things were going well until midway through the first year a classmate of mine nearly attempted suicide himself he had brought a gun into his dorm and was going to shoot himself I convinced him no to do it and went with him to the counselor the next day For whatever reason this had a profound impact on me and sent me into a depression I started seeing a therapist myself and hired a private trainer at the school gym to try and get myself back in shape and address my feelings Things were going OK for the most part going into the second year of my schooling I was very lonely and somewhat disappointed with my choice in school but otherwise I was looking forward to the future because I was cultivating some interesting hobbies I was enjoying working out rock climbing guitar drawing and kayaking During the Christmas break of that year I fell and injured both of my wrists snowboarding for the first time I didn t think much of it at the time but after a month they still hurt and felt unstable I got diagnosed with a torn ligament in my wrist and a couple other complications I was unable to workout like I normally would due to this injury I refocused on school and spent my time there I also got a highly coveted internship at a local hospital When I wasn t focused on my studies my mind dwelled on my wrist I decided to try and rehab my knee I had slightly injured it the summer before I started professional school but I ended up injuring my wrist further doing an exercise the PT had me do Frustrated I gave up trying to rehab my knee At the start of the third year in pharmacy school I had worked during the summer and also done research on the side My health had deteriorated due to not working out and some stress eating The school I chose proved to be a massive disappointment with a disconnected administration filler classes and a seemingly glaring neglect of fundamental concepts I slogged through the year my health concerns continuing to to weigh heavily on me my TMJ became particularly worse and I injured my other wrist I decided in December to leave my internship which was upsetting me and to try pilates as an alternative workout Now I ve found that due to a defect in my hip I have torn cartilage there as well in addition to knee and ankle problems The surgical outcomes for my hip seem more optimistic than my wrist but I m scared of surgery because of past experiences and I m losing a lot of faith in modern medicine I ve tried pursuing relationships during school but as I said earlier I have trouble with trust and I also feel myself pulling back because my health concerns might limit me It also depresses me that the person I end up with will see me as this broken thing and not the driven hard working capable person I was and was trying hard to improve In addition to my health problems I am having difficulty finding more interests to pursue Writing drawing hurts my wrist as does playing guitar I had wanted to hike and backpack more maybe even run but my hip is making that unlikely I also developed a condition known as slipping rib syndrome which makes certain actions very painful difficult I feel like I tried so hard to change who I was years ago and that it s all going to be for nothing I cultivated new interests that I can t do I m stuck at a school I hate taking on debt for something I ve lost the passion in and I am having difficulty romantically because I feel like I can t form a relationship with someone that I d want to because I don t think my health will allow a future with them In a nut shell I feel like I ve lost my identity and died I ve tried several alternatives to try and pick myself up but I seem to keep hitting roadblocks I went from an active person to nearly completely sedentary and my health seems to be deteriorating at a rapid rate with no definitive answers I think of killing myself multiple times a day but what stops me is that I keep hoping I ll get better It has been over a year since I ve injured my wrist and no doctor has given me a definitive treatment answer that I am satisfied with they just seem to go through treatment algorithms rather than think of mine case as unique Now with my hip knee ankle injury I m rapidly losing hope that I ll ever be able to enjoy my life when I m done with schooling Thank you for reading this I m sorry it was so long I just feel like I need someone to understand how hard I have tried and how desperate I m starting to feel I feel so lost and overwhelmed that I can t pull myself out of this I wish someone was there just to feel close

What does seeing a doctor about depression actually do for you I m not really at the suicidal level yet and if I ever were I have a plan in place that would take years to finish anyhow I m not sure if this is the right place for this then but I ve been wondering about what seeing a doctor for depression and getting a diagnosis will actually do for you I ve never talked to my doctor about mental issues but from my experiences and looking at the symptoms I m fairly certain I would be classified as having some form of chronic depression dysthymia and or cyclothymia possibly venturing into a major depression at times It s been this way for years and at times I wonder about asking a doctor about it but I always think back and figure Well what good is that going to do If I was offered a card referral to some counselor I don t think I d be very interested in going I don t have the time nor the money to dedicate to something like that and even if I did I think I would be so against the idea of talking it out to someone about problems that it wouldn t be very effective I know it s a mental issue so it s not like there is some magic pill or surgery that takes care of it I just feel like I d start a process of being thrown to an endless cycle of therapy and counseling So what purpose would there be to seeing a doctor or would there not be any,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update",high

"I started seeing my pdoc in fall of 2012. Around this time, I went into the hospital for suicidal ideation. Little medication change, things were pretty good until spring of 2014. I relapsed hard, purging, cutting, not going to classes. 
 My therapist asked me to start coming in 2x a week, which didn't help and just cost me a ton of money. My pdoc upped me to the maximum dosage of my antidepressant. This really messed me up and I completely broke down and had to go home for the semester.
 I returned last fall, feeling much better after seeing a good therapist in my hometown and switching medications. I was doing pretty well. 
 But for the past month or so, I've been having symptoms that I've never really had before. I can hardly sleep, I can't focus (it takes me forever to read a news article) and I just feel anxious and overstimulated all the time. 
 I saw my pdoc this morning for a regular appointment, but made some of this new stuff clear on my intake sheet. He brushed it all off as stress (I'm working about 25 hours a week this semester.) 
 I feel like saying more would be pushy. I just think that after three years, he's not going to be open to looking into yet another diagnosis. It feels so stagnant. Our appointments are 10 minutes, tops.
 Maybe it is just stress, but I just don't know how to approach this.",Miscellaneous,low

I have multiple mental illnesses and after an unlucky layoff have been unemployed for years so I will be choosing between suicide and very soon Open to unusual suggestions Just read the bold text as a TL DR if you want amp x B Background I graduated with a useless liberal arts degree German that I deeply regret in December The winter graduation date was a result of taking a semester off due to incapacitating mental health issues I have a little OCD some Borderline Personality Disorder traits and am formally diagnosed as Bipolar Type II I take a high dose of Lamictal but due to the nature of my diagnosis I am somewhat medication resistant and therapy has never helped much either I fight intrusive thoughts and extreme depression on a daily basis I have spent out of the years since I graduated unemployed It took me a year to find a job I was laid off from that job after only a year there because the company was doing poorly That happened just eight months after I had left my parents house I didn t even make it a year on my own That was a year and a half ago I cannot find a fucking job I have tried everything amp x B The reality is that someone with almost no experience and no connections and can only rely on the internet to find work is dealing with so much competition that it is almost impossible to find a job without a STEM degree Over the past month for example I have applied to jobs and only made it to a nd round in person interview times So here we are amp x B I m ready to die I have a note and a plan amp x B I have just one friend IRL who I rarely see or hear from On my steam friends list there is one person who I game with sometimes he is a great friend who I have known for a couple years but we have never met My relationship with my parents is nonexistent even though I live with them We have never been close and they have done some fucked up things in the past There is very little guilt associated with the thought of leaving the people who are part of my life behind I have read enough of r SuicideBereavement to know what it d do to them and I don t care most of the time amp x B My suicide method of choice is irreversible Guaranteed to kill me This will not be one of those impulsive acts where someone didn t take enough pills or jumped off of a building that wasn t high enough I will be gone Thus I must be very certain about having no other options left amp x B Your life might be very different from mine and therefore you ll say why not just find a retail or food service job and accept living with your parents That is not something I can accept I didn t push through my terrible mental health issues to graduate with honors to live a life like this This house is full of traumatic memories and as depressed as I am now there is no way I could work at Macy s or Applebees and be stuck in this house indefinitely without getting even worse and killing myself amp x B I refuse to be hospitalized and will not do outpatient either I was too honest with my psychiatrist a couple weeks ago and almost got myself involuntarily committed I have a very bad attitude about therapy and meds Trapping me in a fucking looney bin with nothing but a smock would inevitably lead to me assaulting someone and having even more problems I refuse to be doped up on meds to the point where I think this situation is fucking fine amp x B At this point I don t know what the fuck I can do Here are the things that occur to me at this point in order from most reasonable to least amp x B Sign up for a temp agency and hope to find a temp to permanent role that actually pans out The problem with those jobs is that they do not pay enough to get me out of this fucking house even if it is full time amp x B Accept that my life has fallen apart and that I need to start over and go back to school for a degree that is actually useful That plan would prevent waiting tables or something awful like that from bringing me to suicide amp x B Get a Teaching English as a Foreign Language TEFL certification and leave this country for somewhere with a low cost of living It is going down in flames and I have almost nothing keeping me here anyway I have a car that is worth around that I could sell to get out of here and pay for the certification amp x B Accept my suicide as inevitable living with all of these conditions is fucking terrible and do something radical like selling the aforementioned car and blowing my money on some kind of cross country trip or even a one way ticket to somewhere else k gets you a long way in a third world country You may laugh at this but I m actually kind serious about this one amp x B Kill myself Send my note to everyone as a text before doing it That s it This miserable existence I never asked for would be over I have had sex fallen in love been to Europe enjoyed meaningful friendships done psychedelics Its been nice But I can t take this shit anymore at the same time Every day is the same Sitting at this fucking desk Miserable Insane Lonely Hopeless I think about suicide constantly amp x B Do you have any ideas for me What would you do amp x B,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk,

Just a piece of shitI m and I have had serious relationships in my life My first one started at and went through I was diagnosed with bpd and bipolar disorder at the age of and it caused a lot of problems in my relationships in regards to my being insecure and jealous We ended up getting married but years after we got married I left because my husband was constantly on dating websites which he said he did because I was jealous and nagged at him My second relationship was awful I m pretty sure he has NPD We started as open but he constantly cheated on me then he would claim it was my fault because I was insecure He also got fired months into our relationship for constantly being late to work every day which led to me and his mom financially supporting him I finally got tired of the lying cheating and being used Now I m with a great guy and I can t help but feel like I m fucking up again and I can t deal with it We ve been together since August and I moved in with him last August We had known each other since him and his ex were friends with my ex husband and I so we know each other pretty well When we started dating we discussed having kids he has from his marriage and in November I got pregnant It was my first pregnancy and I was absolutely over the moon We planned it so we found out very early about weeks in Literally the day after we found out I got a call saying my mom was sick I was worried she was going to lay in her bed and die so against my better judgment I told her the news and since I told her might as well tell everyone else Well fast forward to days before my first ultrasound and I start spotting Everyone said it was normal but I was worried The day before I started bleeding heavier and I knew in my heart something was wrong We went in the next day and the screen on the machine was empty and the doctor told us it was a blighted ovum I was devastated That was January th I had a d amp c the next day Ever since then I m so easily irritated and I have no patience I feel like I can t do anything right I used to love to cook but now I worry my boyfriend hates everything I make We talked last night and he basically said he thinks I m not happy and I hate him I told him I feel like he hates me In addition to all of this my dad verbally abused me regularly because he gifted me a car years ago that he bought for his girlfriend who later dumped him I m in no position to buy myself a vehicle so I just have to take it He went off on me yesterday because he didn t like my tone when he made fun of me for making a frozen pizza for dinner Started telling me I m a piece of shit and ungrateful and that I can just pay for my car and he s fucking done with me etc I just feel like a worthless piece of shit,"Cause of Distress, Mental Distress, Progress Update",medium

I don t belong here I m not sure what I to say or how I to say it I m not sure why I am even writing this because I don t want to hear what people have to say I guess I just want this out there somehow Even if I did want advice no anyone can say anything that will help I highly doubt anyone will even really care Sometimes people think they care but how much of that is because they actually care and how much is because they ve been conditioned to believe they should Have you ever had the feeling of being at a party or event surrounded by people but still feeling alone I feel like that all the time One time in college I decided to get a minor in math I tried to make friends in that department as well as my own department but I always felt like an outsider I felt like I was looking into a fish tank While I liked seeing them and while I felt like I could understand them and their behavior I simply could not exist in their environment I feel like I don t belong on earth My dad had some anger management issues when I was young I never really thought anything of it I just figured that s how things were and it was no big deal Now that I ve been seeing a psychiatrist she explained to me that even though consciously I don t see it as a big deal subconsciously it has left me damaged somehow she didn t actually say damaged As I got older I found out my dad was suspected by a psychiatrist of being bipolar he never went through the full range of tests to prove it I don t blame him because he can t control being or not being bipolar I wonder if I will end up with it as well or if it s true that all his anger has affected me I ve read other stories of people who were abused and therapist type people say that can lead to them being easy targets for others to abuse them later When I was about I was molested by a neighbor who was just a few years older than me I m curious if one of the reasons why I was molested was because of what I said in the previous paragraph I remember a therapist once told me I might have a fear of intimacy I m not sure if that could have been caused by the molestation It only happened once so I m not sure why I can t just get over it I ve tried finding a girlfriend in real life and on dating websites but I get nowhere I ve been able to meet some women but as soon as I get too close to them I start to get nervous and anxious I ve had sex but I never really enjoyed it I think mostly because I wasn t really into them but I kind of just went along with it I m not really sure why I ve also had a lot of what I call pseudo girlfriends women who I m just friends with but we hangout a lot and sometimes even cuddle I know you re probably thinking why not ask one of them to take our friendship to the next level Well I have and that s never worked out for me and I just end up losing friend The more I go on I feel less and less connected to the world I know eventually I am going to end my life one day maybe not soon but one day,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update, Seeking Help",high

Last NightLast night I spent some of the last of my money at the bar getting blackout drunk I talked about football with this random guy I talked about first downs and special teams while I was choking back tears I got to that sweet part of the night where I went cross eyed I was seeing double of everything and I had a pounding headache I decide to engage in this self sabotaging behavior because I want to make it easier to finally end my life I get drunk and kill off the microscopic bit of hope I have so I have nothing to cling to when considering suicide I sat at the bar almost falling off the stool and it really hit me this time I really could kill myself tonight I always wondered what it would feel like to finally go over the edge what would your own brain sound like in the moment where you became ok with dying Was it peaceful was it scary was it just somewhere in between What it is is the feeling that beyond a shadow of a doubt you would not feel the consequences of suicide because you will be dead All of my friends My family If I had the choice I would end my life without hurting them but in reality I won t exist it won t effect me it will be nothing I silently decided ok I think tonight is the night I stood up turned to the guy I was talking to smiled and told him to have a great night He gave me a drunken pat on the back and said ok you too and I left My first thought was are you ok with that guy being the last human being you talk to And immediately I thought yes Who cares It s all symbolic horse shit that won t mean anything after I m dead It s the same nonsense that makes people want to have their ashes scattered at the beach and that s never been me so why should I care I left the bar and just started walking I didn t know where I was going but I really hoped the courage to end it was at my destination I walked through downtown Tucson for a bit I started looking at all these beautiful college kids at the clubs and bars all with a major a plan a path I ve never really envied them or at least I never thought walking their path would make me happier but my whole life was spent trying to rationalize how me and all of them could have such wildly different journeys on this planet for better or for worse Last night though I couldn t help but find the humor in it Everyone of them that saw me walk passed probably assumed I was someone that I went to school somewhere that I had an identity outside of being nobody It made me think about how there s probably plenty of people I see actively contemplating their death that just blend in like me It made me think even if it were just for a second to reconsider what I aimed to do that night I thought about it for a second I thought about just going home and sleeping it off and keeping on keeping on in the morning Then I remembered I already made my choice I didn t sabotage my chances at the future so I could back out now I intended to do what I ve known needed to be done since I was I kept walking and walking and walking I walked past a gas station with a cigarette ad in the window I thought about what a shame it was that I quit smoking for my health I thought about how now in retrospect I should of eaten Mcdonalds and chocolate cake everyday I should of done Heroin and every other drug under the sun I thought about how tame my life was because there was a tomorrow to live for At this I was out of downtown and well into the outskirts of Tucson It was about AM at this point I finally reached a highway It wasn t like an interstate more like a lane avenue that has a sidewalk running alongside it I d see these wheelers come buy at MPH Upon seeing this I could feel almost muscle spasms in my knees that were willing me to jump in front of one of these things I thought about it for a second What if I jump and they swerved and caused an accident What if it killed other people but not me I couldn t bring myself to do it for that reason I continued walking down the highway Even though I wasn t gonna jump in front of one of these cars everyone that passed filled my head with visuals of me splattered all of the road I walked until I saw a park I don t know what possessed me but I just entered the park with no intention I spotted a bench and threw myself in to it I leaned over the side and vomited then I passed out I woke up hours later with an awful headache Something about the way I felt just told me I had missed my chance to end my life I knew that the state I was in before I passed out was my opportunity to finally have the balls to do it and I let it slip away I don t know when I ll ever be able to capture it again Today I woke back up in purgatory where I ll remain Life is endless suffering,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk",high

There s a bridge near my new house On Tuesday morning I woke up feeling exhausted My head was pounding with a headache my nose snuffed up my shoulders hurt my chest was tight my back was aching I cried I cried hard I cried about the rash consuming my legs I cried about how I have little meaningful relationships I cried about how I assume people think of me I cried about my job And my living situation I cried about being different I pulled myself together for a moment and decided to go to a walk in clinic Something I ve been putting off for months I went downstairs and jumped in the shower And I sobbed while washing my hair And screamed and yelled at myself and the world not through anger or hate but because of my inability to change or more so the self sabotage that I routinely commit I dried off avoiding my reflection in the mirror I microwaved some chicken fingers and drank a bottle of water I watched a YouTube video about a board game And then I cried some more I called the local mental health crisis centre where I ve dragged myself to in the past because they ve called me twice in two weeks and I haven t returned either of their calls I scheduled a meeting with a counsellor for two weeks from now knowing damn well I might not make it that far I don t have a doctor but I know what I do have and undiagnosed mental illness Or I m looking for a crutch Something to label myself so I know it s not my fault for putting myself in the positions I do At this point I was dressed and ready to leave my house I put on my sunglasses and headed out but I didn t head toward the busy main street or the clinic I started off toward the bridge A pedestrian bridge towering above jagged rocks and a river with an unforgiving current I walked slowly and confidently down the street toward the park housing the bridge My mind ablaze with the thoughts of ending it The image of myself laying upon the rocks for hours My lungs filling with blood Cold Scared But I turned at the last second Left instead of right And just walked for hours I walked until the road ended and I was exhausted Then I walked back on the busy main street Watching the people going on with their days Only stopping the get a pack of cigarettes which I had quit two months prior and a coffee And then I went home The thoughts are still there but I have them in check again To die another day,"Cause of Distress, Positive Coping",medium

One last shot before i make the final decisionM throwaway for obvious reasons amp x B After spending several months deperately trying to find a plan or another way out of this mess i haven t come up with a single viable solution so i will try to post this somewhere for someone to read maybe even care Story Suicide and depression have always been in my blood my father hanged himself when i was just and my big brother jumped in front of a train when i was It s important for me to say that i have had a good life my youth was not a place of depression or despair at all I had friends girls and i did really well in high school despite almost no attempt I had a quirk however that still destroys me to this day i have this tendency to push people away in a very dramatic way when they get to close That naturally do mean that i speak to noone from my high school days or even before the majority have explicit hate towards me Anyway the story of how i am where i am today During studying for my B Sc https B sc i got a relevant part time job on the side and i absolutely hated every minute of it I made the choice to finish my degree and basicly take extra cources regarding topics that cought my interest and i could ses myself pursueing a career in Since my B Sc https B Sc is in economics and business administration i had the opportunity to influence it to a certain degree Fast forward to when i completed my B Sc https B Sc I was incredibly lucky to get enrolled into exactly the master s degree i had intented on top of that i met the girl of my dreams Everything was lining up perfectly and the plan was made Study like a madman spend time with the girl and apply for relevant part time jobs or internships rince and repeat every day And i did However my grades were going down the drain and despite several interviews i did not get any job months into my Masters my self esteem is non existent and its taking a toll on my relationsship Since my GF would never even think of leaving me at the time she was always a bubbly person and her life was progressing quickly for the better she put things on hold to help me get up again This were something i could not live with i have no intention of holding anyone back or make their life a compromise so i decided to leave her I still remember the last thing i said to her at the time This is the biggest mistake i have ever made in my life Fast forward months things are going even worse i completely realize that soon have a close to worthless degree and cant get a job and i am ashamed to even see my friends who s lifes are lining up perfectly However one day a hear a silent knock on my front door Its my now Ex girlfriend with tears in her eyes she tells me she loves me and i am the only one she ever wants to be with i tell her i love her first time i ever told anyone We get back together The next months are horrible i start seing a psychotherapist without my girl knowing I am diagnosed with depression anxiety and sleep deprivation I get medication for all of it For some reason every second is pure agony to me and i eventually plan my own suicide January By November I decide to leave my now ex girl to lessen the blow of me passing away Going all november and december planning my suicide while doing my exams I somehow decide the give life another chance It s hard to explain but people around you can sense when you doing horrible i got random message from friends telling me i was a good guy and other encouriging words out of the blue despite no one knowing of my condition New years eve i get a long text from my ex girlfriend that she loved me she will never forget me that we might me some where down the line in a better place One week after i decide to go to her place just the way she did for me in hopes of a sweet reunion However things go really dark She is home with another guy She s angry at me she s says she hates me She tells me that she called the cops Right after she deletes and blocks me from any form of contact and social media One month later she s engaged to this succesful rich and handsome guy seemingly as happy as she wll ever be She loved me until she found something better The months after are tough i plan another date for my suicide July I continue to write my masters thesis and try to meet new people I just delivered my master thesis its horrible final nail in the coffin for my GPA I managed to get no part time jobs or internships despite applications during my studies I have applied for close to full time jobs the last months No interviews The girl of my dreams are getting married to a guy who is everything i tried to be but could not By October i will be out on the streets with nothing but debt My friends are doing well and i am ashamed to see them I once heard someone say that suicide is only a viable option when there is no hope for a better future I believe there isn t Even if i get a job to scrape by I will have to live a miserable lonely live because of the decisions i made I dont believe i can I still want to emphasize that i have had a good life However i do not believe there are any more happy moments for me Spoiled i know Sorry for not so well written english and the wall of text I expect nothing but it certaintly does not hurt to write it out,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update, Seeking Help",high

I was planning a tattoo to get that would cover all my old scars,Miscellaneous,low
"I was talking to my bf about (funnily enough) BPD traits that I’d learned the explanations of on Tiktok. I was giving an example of one (about tying yourself too much to your actions, so that when someone asks you to do something, like, “Do you mind putting your cup somewhere else next time?,” you get oddly angry and defensive because it feels like they attacked you personally), and I gave an example of my own. I guess it was too pointed with the tone I used, because my bf accused me of having a specific time in mind that involved him, and became on edge and told me I was getting triggered and needed to take medicine. No matter how many times I told him that I didn’t have a specific instance in mind and that I didn’t mean to sound so pointed, I don’t think he believed me. He just wanted me to hurry up and go have some space so I wouldn’t freak out. 
 
 And it’s like WHY does it have to be that I’m attacking him when I am not?? I’ve had a lot of trouble with it before, and can still struggle now, but I’m trying to be BETTER. Even when I notice I’m getting triggered, I’ll sometimes try to diffuse my emotions/distract myself by showing my bf a funny video I found on tiktok. And does it matter? Of course not! All that matters was that I got triggered in the first place, and that’s a point against me. 
 
 Why does it feel like people WANT me to be the fucking problem sometimes? I swear, I’m trying to get better, but it doesn’t matter to anyone! They’re used to me having a problematic role, and that’s just where I’m supposed to stay. 
 
 If I get triggered, I’m a toxic lunatic. If I tell people that I was able to cope better and not freak out this time, it’s a little “good job,” and then forgetting it ever happened. And that happens with EVERYTHING, not just my BPD. 
 
 I’m largely seen as lazy and irresponsible, and it’s TRUE. I’m a waste of space! But, when I finally accomplish a tiny step forward, it’s fine, but not a big deal, because I should’ve been doing that already.
 
 Why do ANYTHING, then?? Myself and the people around me have gotten too used to how awful I am. We’re all too comfortable. But, I really wanna feel/do better and FEEL SEEN.","Cause of Distress, Mental Distress, Mood Tracking, Progress Update",medium
It just seems like the right idea at the moment Hi reddit I ve lurked a while and things in my life have lately come to a fever pitch I feel trapped by everything and I don t feel like I live in a world where I m truly free anymore My relationships are burning me alive and even my friendships feel porous and deceitful I could use the kind words cause I know there are no answers I included my poetry I don t know why I guess to seem like an individual worth encouraging I can t escape the overriding feeling that everything in my life is rotting Thanks for your time I m a well traveled man with a stride and a plan to wander less near from so far But nothing I will see or ever have seen beats back the Big Bang in my yard See Williker Tidds who lived with his kids was a bootlegger hot off the south and when prohibition brought in inhibition Ol Williker whistled his mouth and said Jesus H Christ boy these people these people All looking for just a load off Now run back and forth and stay drunk on the sly While the cops they retreat from the law And though the money all goes up the expenses hose What if one could handle the weight Could one make such a still that its liquor would fill Every Sub Mason Dixon Line State Well Jehosephat Joe I know just where to go there s a rock that fell out of the sky And its shiny and hard and not an inch of its charred even though ten foot round the brush died And the sound it creates when you hit it or knock it is softer than you think it would And the air doesn t smell like there s burning in fact the scent surrounding s quite good But its steel like and feels like a distant vibration a rail for a train yet to come And its cold as a spring even though the damn thing is just cookin right there in the sun So he brought in a team and they all got the rock to sit stark on the back of his trailer And he hammered and blacksmithed and worked on great sheets of the asteroid thinner and paler And with tireless zeal and a few hurried meals Tidds fashioned a splendid machine And he stuffed it with grains and he churned up a batch that he knew would be sweet strong and clean But when the day came to cash in on his game Williker gasped cause he wasn t sure If inside of the still floating round in the mash was a light so bright and so pure that a glance would set ones imagination on fire and the soul too would in rapture burn For the colors contained in that shimmer or glimmer would take a gods mind just to learn And he swallowed and watched with a glow on his face and a helpless look right in his eyes He said Mercy what what is that and then went inside and turned off the light But at night he rest stubbornly and the thoughts in his head Ran around in insomniac roar And when he sat on the edge of the foot of his bed The light glowed outside of his door With a start he stood up and ran right to his still which emitted a casual hum and the light that shot out from the top of the tank lit the night like a placebo sun And his shout was so loud that was wife the old cow woke and waddled outside just to yell But the second she saw what dropped Willikers jaw then so too Etnas jaw promptly fell For the tank had been melting for quite a long time and the whiskey had boiled away And the brand new universe just sat there shining at the end of its very first day Theres a lot going on in universe spawn some things that you really can t know Like the sound planets make when theyre bumping and thumping as the galaxies they re inside grow And the trillion quarks making zillions of sparks as they bristle and crystal collide And the nebulas blooming and supernovas booming for young stars are too doomed to die And just hanging in air over two wide eyed stares the universe gained dimension and size And its growth was quite slow But quite steady and so in a year the Tidds moved lest they died For their house had been burned by a baby red giant like a superball coated with lava And their vase was erased by tiny black hole and some meteors got on the guavas And the living conditions grew dimmer and dimmer in the town where Williker lived And as land was devoured while men scattered and cowered People knew that something had to give For insurance adjusters had no clue what to write when the house was clearly just gone and replaced by universe golden and glowing and taking more insured houses on Then the government came with their titles and names and declared the small town a lost cause And in haste the whole state had to evacuate said the brand new ex states new state laws And for year after year the grand spectacle grew Until Tennessee was just an orb That hung twinkling high like a jewel in the sky Looking for a new state to absorb And slowly we retreat with the back of our feet hot from The Fires of Wondrous Creation But we all kinda wish that the need for the booze hadn t set up our own immolation For the commune we live in at the edge of the world while it numbers a billion strong Loses faith as the land that we have slips away and may be gone before way too long But there s hope in my heart for the world and its arts because the future is exceedingly bright For inside of the Big Bang the suns live so close that their day is no different from night And I m not really scared I m in love with my fate swallowed whole by the future constructive But maybe sometimes in the back of my mind i wish drinking was much less destructive,"Cause of Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Mental Distress",medium

BF Constantly Threatening SuicideSo I m a little nervous about making this post because I don t really want to be found out but this is beyond my understanding anymore The man I have dated for a long time is a widely intelligent attractive man In the beginning it was pure magic We spent a lot of time together we went out on dates etc Then I moved to college and came back home It was toward the end of last year that this all began Out of nowhere he started threatening to hang himself because I was being negative While I ve always known to take threats seriously I kinda let it slide because maybe I pissed him off and didn t realize it He blames me for being negative and a drama queen and this is causing him to want to kill himself I know this isn t the full story I know there must be something else going on At the end of the day I am not responsible for his suicide I am not legally bound to him in any way Problems got worse when one day he came over and we were fighting about something stupid The fight rose to the point where he is screaming at me saying I am going to hurt you and me begging him not to touch me Eventually he grabbed me called me stupid among other things I cowered and threw my hands over my face attempting to shield myself thinking he was actually going to strike But he threw me aside I begged him to calm down and he wasn t being rational He finally agreed to relax but then started screaming again At this point he was thrown out for threatening me Fast forward Most days it is ok I don t hear from him much and try to give him space to work on his projects but these episodes of suicide can occur when I least expect it At times he told me he had a rope and made a noose out of it He tried it and caused harm to himself apparently I honestly believe that some of this is false The other day I fell asleep on him and he told me he still had the noose in his closet if I don t stop being negative The problem with all of this is that it is starting to affect my level of sanity If I don t hear from him for like half a day I immediately start thinking he has hurt himself I know you ll day get rid of him I am just wondering if there is a real way to diagnose the problem I wish I knew what to do,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update",high

I feel like my suicide would be perfectly fitting poetic justice Is that the right term This is what I mean As far as I know my school s never had a suicide If anyone should kill themselves not that anyone should it should be me It would have the biggest effect if it was me It would seem reasonable and people would be shocked but wouldn t be SURPRISED I was very severely bullied every day for years by people and about at once The teachers had never seen bullying so extreme The ENTIRE YEAR hated me and almost everyone knew it I was the most hated person in the year maybe even the school for NO REASON Or at least nothing in my control Bullying is one of the most horrible things of humanity I have been depressed for about the last years And I have very very few friends and no social life at all Having no friends damages your self esteem in every way possible I never did ANYTHING intentionally wrong to the people who bullied me I just burst into tears writing this I didn t deserve a single SECOND of the hell they gave me EVERY DAY for years If I killed myself all those kids would think She really did it and would say WE drove her to this and kids at neighbouring schools would say You know my name who got picked on She committed suicide and A girl from my school killed herself And Everyone made fun of one girl for no reason and always made a joke out of her and were so mean to her and there were always so many bystanders but NO ONE EVER STUCK UP FOR HER because they all just wanted to follow the crowd thinking Oh it s my name so it s okay to treat her like SHIT and look down on her and TELL HER to KILL HERSELF and then just go on with their day like it s nothing and now she s dead Then my death could at least raise awareness and maybe definitely reduce bullying at my school and the pastoral support would double Maybe that was my purpose after all Also no one would care if I wasn t there I would walk into our house common room and the same boy would announce my entrance to the whole crowd and while everyone silenced would shout GET OUT LARA NO ONE WANTS YOU HERE in such a sincere way They made it pretty clear I was unwanted there No one really cares about me Or maybe they all care just not enough The only way people would care about me is if I was dead Similarly I ve been thinking what if the only way to not feel bad is to stop feeling anything at all forever I don t want to stall too much so that I ve left school when I do it because then the school won t take responsibility and will be able to say it wasn t because of them I don t want the wrong people to be blamed I don t know how much longer I can go on It s like a candle is burning and I don t know how much is left of it height but I can tell from the puddle of wax on top it isn t much It wouldn t be a loss if I died and I would actually be doing people a favour,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Seeking Help",high

A Story the quest for love has taken it s tollYou have heard the expression it s better to have loved and loss than never to have loved at all Lies what folk often forget is the psychological and emotional toll that multiple failed relationships has on people each one chips away at your mental health and adds baggage that stays with you for most of your life I have no idea what day it is today but I start each morning with tears flooding my face and a crippling desire to not exist anymore I d like to drop my life story here on the offhand that someone somewhere reads this and can relate with me on some level throwaway for good measure brace yourself for a really long read location UK NO Early life I was lucky enough that my family could afford to place me in a posh private school for pretentious wizards Unfortunately this education was wasted on me as my depression unwillingly began when I was thirteen years old yet I could not comprehend what depression was at this age I was also addicted to the video game world of warcraft WoW Both the cloudyness of being down and the constant thought of when can I get home for my fix left me void of motivation to partake in education University life I had zero social skills due to days I had racked up in WoW but somehow managed to land a girl from a club let s call her X X was half British and half Norwegian she was shy family orientated and equally inexperienced in life We did nothing but watch TV the rest of this chapter is boring let s fast forward UK worklife Through the aid of a lecturer I scored a job working for a top US ISP in a data centre hours north where I lived the city was dirty and work gave me crippling anxiety When you re anxious depressed your judgement is clouded colors are less vivid and all food tastes the same I constantly made elementary mistakes which only made the anxiety and depression worse I never focused in school and the stimulation from gaming destroyed my attention span Four years past and although she never vocalize these words X really wanted to start a family X was also an engineer and quite intelligent We had spontaneous intercourse one night and later I worried it could lead to a pregnancy she reassured me it was impossible on her current cycle I return after a twelve hour night shift to discover a positive pregnancy test prominently left on the bathroom counter I was twenty one years old with no life experience shocked and dismayed did I even love X or did I simply love the security a relationship brings I push for an abortion and she reluctantly agrees I know I m an asshole Things get weird nothing is familiar anymore I m tired of my job hate the dirty city and pose the idea to X that we move to Norway she s fluent I m lost what could go wrong Grand adventure I got a job for another US tech company before leaving UK we travel to Oslo with our possessions and Gandalf the dog and ferry and drive our way across UK up Denmark and across to Norway I did not integrate well mostly my fault and the fact we moved based on a semi ultimatum X is unemployed for months We had been dating six years at this point I had an emerald engagement ring X finally gets a programmer job but cheats on me with the guy twice her age who mentored her I spiral hard new country confused lost heartbroken they speak great English in Norway but I didn t know any Norwegian and this blew my anxiety and depression up I drink for a week straight I got into bitcoin and crypto mining as a hobby before it exploded then I discovered this could be used to buy narcotics off the darkweb Twenty six years old and I d never touched a cigarette or drugs other than alcohol I buy benzodiazepines off the darknet This opened the floodgates as it temporarily cured my issues and my quest was to try the rest V Before online dating turned to shit I met V half Norwegian half American lots of fun I kept up the drug routine and expanded my desk draw with a variety of disassociatives psychadelics depressants and stimulants I wanted to move to California with V as our vacations there were eye opening I got denied after roughly job applications serendipitously I got a targeted email from a renowned tech company doing R amp D work in the video conferencing market dream company and dream job depression and anxiety prevail V and I still had fun but I went crazy and occasionally psychotic I pushed V away and we split and then realised I was back to square X this prompted my first suicide attempt using a litre of sambuca mg diazapam and a gram of mdma in the hopes my organs would cook whilst I was in a benzo sleep state I took the pills and put the bottle to my head I passed out before I could reach for the mdma baggy I woke up in hospital ICU hours later When I woke the first thing I tried to do is strangle myself with the beeping machines power cable staff intervened and I was placed in a psych ward for a while The dream The job was perfect I should be happy I was under qualifyied but these people enjoy the stories and bullshit I spew in interviews Two years pass nothing changes I m lonely abuse takes over Usual life is pointless angle I ve tested all the drugs at this point except opioids I order heroin with the sole intention of permanent overdose No toleranse I snort there entire bag I sink into my bed no further I sank through the ground and down into the earth s crust It felt horrible A part of me didn t want to die just sleep forever I call my Swedish friend and explain the overdose he calls and ambulance Hell I wake up in hospital very psychotic everyone is trying to kill me the walls are caving in and extremely colorful smoke floods the room the tv gives reports of a male rapist and the possible suspect is me I feel the hospital is in on the jig and see them trying to take DNA from me blood in an attempt to frame me for this non existed crime why would Norwegian news be in English One night I escape I run far but I don t know where I am or how to navigate the hospital security track me down and escort me back to my bed The next day a tall in stature ripped private security guard appears at my door Yes Finally protection from the nurses with no faces and the snipers outside that I ve been ducking all week Wrong so so wrong I later found out he was there to stop me escaping and to protect the staff from me I cried in broad daylight when I figured this out Doctors told me they ran MRI s in the extended duration I was unconscious to check for brain activity no dignity left at this point Fast forward back to the psych ward familiar faces Realization I was staying in this country simply for the job yet I was still insanely depressed lonely and no ambition to integrate with the knowledge of the fact that I m here only because of X I met another girl called Y we bonded over drugs unfortunately this is what my life has become she was nice but attraction faded we lived together for six months on and off work was getting more intense I was making more mistakes due to the usual three things Y had a hash smoking habit we smoked a lot but I couldn t handle the pressure anymore and I decide to move back to England Familiar land My tech job and incredible manager let me teleconference work from home for a bit whilst I landed on my feet Problem is I never landed I stayed with my mom for a bit she has bipolar and schizophrenia This is after my parents divorce my dad was an esteemed doctor saw the signs tried his best but couldn t help as she did not believe there was a problem but everyone else is looking at the fucking huge elephant in the room I m talking about the mental health stigma not my mom she s only mildly obese She is money obsessed she divorced my dad for cash She knew I had an engineer job and wanted me to fund renovations on the house she got from the cash split in the divorce I did not oblige and called her irrational over some remarks she made Her response was well atleast I haven t been in as many psych wards as you I got mad and flipped a table in the hall nothing got damaged heated reaction She called the police on me for not paying her lifestyle or making noise Anyway her property her rules the really friendly and pretty cool police obliged and drove me to my dad at a secret location due to being afraid of what my mom is capable of I don t want to go down this road but my father lives a lot of secrecy and I could write a book on the psychology that binds his half of the family together New beginnings I rush and find rented accommodation Things seem good I meet a new girl Z Now Z is incredibly rude but I was attracted to her dark and dirty side Relationship moves fast she drunkenly says I love you multiple times but then forgets it happened at the two week mark I meet her entire family we argued over some trivial things she also lived minutes from my home she broke it off after a pitiful six weeks I make new guy friends and the next months go well However depression kicks in full drive I can t focus function I just want sleep or constant sleep I order a bunch of oxy and heroin and this is attempt four shan t speak of three as it was really dumb I nodded out and awake god knows how many hours later which is really confusing and at the time more depressing I can t even off myself how depressing is that I was out for a very long

Feels like I have a crisis every day But I could swear I m not depressedWell I feel like I am but not that much I never really cry or feel THAT sad but I just know I want to die so so much But my parents and sisters will have to suffer for a while if I go I have like an existential crisis everyday and I really can t be bothered to get help I m waiting to feel shitty enough to end myself I don t think any of this really matters I m in bed right now just watching YouTube and typing this I feel as average as can be but this feeling I just want to fucking DIE I really don t appreciate the way I turned out If I could be bothered I d get help but it s just so much effort I started on sertraline for a month and just went cold turkey because I couldn t be bothered to get prescription Never felt any side effects from stopping Legitimately I m not even sad I m not sure what s wrong with me I have made a lot of positive changes flipped my way of thinking of many things I no longer fear being lonely and I feel content with many things But I know for sure I want to die I m so confused Someone PM and ask me some shit just to give me some attention until I no longer feel this way There s so much I want to get off my chest I even forget what I wanted to say There s definitely a reason for this post but for the life of me I can t remember Or something I definitely wanted to say Brain machine broke,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update",high
Being alive is hellBut dying I feel like I will be copping out without trying to figure out all the life shit first I m in an abusive not marraige I can t tell anyone what s happening to me or they d try to help and make it worse My kids have to deal with me being absent mentally and barely functional because of whats happening And a long history of C PTSD and depression on my end I love my children so much I hide all this from them they are too little and it would damage them immensely to know what was really happening I didn t want kids not when I had them I knew it was too soon But I didn t have the courage to abort Hyper religious upbringing Not til way later twice after any inkling of religion was pounded out of me You can only deal with what I have for so long before God either becomes an enemy or a sad fairy tale told to the foolish and naive And I would think that it was temporary Except this has gone on in some form my entire life It s unspeakable I will never never get justice for what has been done I can barely speak about it in even the most general terms In addition to that I am now being evaluated for an uncommon and highly stigmatized disorder I just want to have a normal life Just be able to do normal things Get out of bed to a house that s not a pig sty mostly thanks to chronic illness and my incredibly useless excuse for a partner who barely works rn and gets paid to stay home but still makes no progress on the mess and won t communicate about it without becoming abusive and effectively traumatizing me into a meltdown and shutdown I have no one I am an orphan there is nowhere to run I have tried The shelters are worse than home The few friends who offered me and the children shelter expected me to be healthy despite me being very open about my health issues and mental health severity and then tried to exploit me as bad or worse than he does Just What is the point,"Cause of Distress, Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Seeking Help",medium
it s rude to have guests over if you re deadmy brain keeps yelling at me that i could just take my entire bottle of zoloft right now if i really wanted to and i could die and it d all be easier i got diagnosed with bpd earlier this week but i has to be wrong because no one has said anything for the over years i ve been in therapy i m a bad person i already know that and i m not crazy i saw this video of a woman who talked about gt writing letters to people in her own blood lt and like i m crazy i guess but not that crazy i m just thinking about dying and i realize no one would miss me and the people who say they would are probably just lying to me because everyone leaves and why would anyone anywhere ever try to help me or actually care it s just fucking ridiculous imagining that anything good will happen when it never will the only thing keeping me from doing it is that i have a guy coming over to build my pc with me later and i think it d be kinda rude to invite someone over and then when they show up you re dead i mean that s giving them an experience they weren t asking for and would probably fuck them up for life amp x B if anything this is all just a stupid feeling that s gonna pass later and by the time he leaves i ll be fine and i don t wanna come off like an attention whore like i m sure everyone thinks i am but i know no one is gonna respond to this it s just easy to yell into the void i guess,"Cause of Distress, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help",medium

Closer than I ve ever been before I am a monumental fuck up From age until I was a drug addict I pushed any friend that tried to help me or wanted to keep me grounded in reality away and embraced the ones who facilitated me getting high Also during this period of time from about I found myself taking care of my ailing mother and complete ignoring myself other than to get my fix of course COPD and lung cancer ravaged her for a long time and I would sit high as a kite and do whatever I could for her because there was no one else to help In my mind I thought when her suffering ends maybe mine will too And I really believed this to some degree When she finally passed I remained addicted depressed even more so as one of my best friends died during this time and isolated for about one more year maybe a year and a half Then I got extremely sick and was so miserable that I just decided to give everything up while I was sick And it somehow it worked for me I ve been clean and sober from opiates opiate substitutes cocaine crack cigarettes marijuana and anything else that I found myself abusing for five years now in December Which is good and all but now I do not know what to do with myself and a hopeless feeling like one I ve never felt before is slowly crushing me I haven t been officially employed for more than a decade I did not go to college I want to go but I have no idea where to start and have no one to talk about this with and feel like even if I did I would just breakdown I look at my peers and everyone is happy with a family and a career and then here I am with nothing to show but the damage I ve done to my body with my horrible decisions I truly feel like maybe it would be best if I just disappeared Just went out one night to some remote area and blew my brains out I ve had this thought before but as I keep wasting time I just feel like it s a reasonable solution,"Cause of Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Mental Distress, Positive Coping",medium
Had a life and everything that entails lost it due to medical mistakes and after years of suffering and being alone I just want out But as you all know that is easier said than done I had a great career was super healthy and fit had a beautiful and smart fiancee who showed me she loved me every day then when more and more medical crap went wrong at the hands of shitty doctors I lost my job and insurance and then all my savings my fitness ability to do anything I enjoyed and the last thing I had this woman who loved me more than anything left me I haven t felt good for about years I am Haven t worked for and haven t had sex for I am the guy people make fun of when they say old guy who lives with his family I don t live in the basement but that s only because it s too full of crap I hate being here and have no privacy and they hate me being here I have been fighting for SSDI for a couple of years now and at this point even maybe winning it won t change that much for me in the big picture and since I have had such shitty lying doctors I have doubts about my ability to win because my records all cover their asses not my ass My conditions won t get better and maybe worse so there isn t any hope if a recovery just mitigating the pain and effects I have nothing to offer a woman and I have a lot of pain that would make sex difficult and probably weird for her so I don t see the year dry spell ending anytime soon I have thought about checking out off and on through the years but just kept going for some pointless reason Fear mostly of screwing up or hurting the handful of people who care a little though they would be hurt far out of proportion to how much I actually mean to them now because they are all drama lovers I have tried therapy and meds but they don t solve the underlying problems so it s just more side effects and hassle with no real results Just fucking tired I cannot see any practical reason to keep going I am sort of past the point of being willing to keep suffering every second of my life so other people don t have to feel bad I decided it wasn t noble to suffer when they don t really care that much it s stupid and selfish of them to expect me to suffer so they don t have to think about it I am really REALLY fucking angry because I had a great life It was stolen from me by greedy fucked up doctors who lied in their records the And their insurance companies who have lobbied to put award caps in place make it really hard for people to win legit malpractice cases anymore since law firms won t help on contingency unless they will get big profits So greed ruined my life in effect and kept me from getting compensated Angry hurting lonely tired,"Cause of Distress, Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Progress Update",medium

"I have had anxiety, depression and mental illness much of my life. I have not been able to get proper treatment at my local mental health clinic. In some ways they have helped me immensely. I have been able to get my pure obsessional OCD under control so I no longer have such bad symptoms. It still definitely is there and sometimes flares up a bit, but it is just faded background noise for the most part. In other ways my mental health has significantly deteriorated. In the mid-2010s I completely lost the self confidence I had gained during my time in college when I found my tribe and got better in my art skills. I could not finish college and had to drop out due to my mental illness and ADHD and have been trying to get by as a freelance artist. I am mostly living on disability though and have not been able to earn anything close to a living wage. If I would attempted this without financial aid from the government, I would be living with my parents. And if my parents had not supported me, god knows where I would be. I would probably be homeless, which I know happened to a college friend of mine. His parents did not support his artistic pursuits and he had to quit school because they would kicked him out. My mental health is in very bad shape and has been for several years now. Since 2017 I have been completely incapacitated by the co-morbid disorders I have been dealing with. I have severe social anxiety, agoraphobia, body dysmorphic disorder, as well as ADHD and autism spectrum disorder. I also have C-PTSD. My parents have to drive me everywhere because driving terrifies me and I cannot even call a taxi because of my social anxiety and C-PTSD - which makes me terrified of being in a space with people I do not know where there is no quick exit - sitting with a taxi driver would mean I would be unable to escape easily if they turned out to be mean - I know it is highly unlikely but it still scares me. My friend had one experience with a mean taxi driver when she was in her late teens.So I had the crazy idea of trying out a drawing/art video blog, as it seems to be lucrative and you tubers earn a passive income, which I think would be great instead of just relying on government financial aid. I want to do it but I do not think I would be any good at it. It actually seems impossible for me because even though I have decent drawing skills, I have no people skills. I am socially handicapped by my mental disorders. One of the main reasons I draw is because I have such a hard time talking to people and drawing helps make me feel more comfortable around them. I have no idea how I would ever feel comfortable enough to talk on camera and not scare people away. I do not want to be insincere or fake and pretend to be more talkative and bubbly than I am. I have actually thought of doing a voice changer thing or just captions as talking just scares the hell out of me. I am scared of my voice or name being recognized by bullies and being stalked and harassed in real life or online. I may try one video and perhaps not even post it but just get a feel for it and if it does not work I will not bother. It is a multi-skilled vocation to be an art vlogger. You have to also have good people skills as well as video-making skills. I hate the idea of only video blogging with the hope of earning money but hating people. I like it when the youtuber is genuinely friendly and acknowledges their followers and all that. I would not want to put people off with my unfriendliness from social anxiety and not responding to comments or messages, or turning off comments. I just do not really know what to do with myself. I am not cut out for this existence. I feel powerless, I am a mess and do not know how to prevent my life from going to sh*t","Cause of Distress, Mental Distress",medium

Day Hey Sorry I was delayed with Day update but I was really out of it today and pretty much stayed in bed as much as possible all day I decided on this update I should probably give some back story about me so you can get a better understanding as to why Im here where I am now Im a yr old female and come from a pretty rough childhood I was molested abused both physically and verbally by relatives and grew up with no money in our household My mum was an alcoholic from pretty much as far as I can remember and my Dad left us when I was Because of Mums alcohol abuse I was the primary care giver for my two younger brothers Im the second oldest but our older brother is years older than me so he moved away from this fucked up family as soon as he could and I was left to care for my Mum and brothers We had to live with my Grandpa when I was because he was getting too old to care for himself yet somehow he had the energy to beat me and kill my cat in front of me when he got angry It was always me who was the target My brothers were treated like royalty and I was treated like scum But I tried my best to keep pushing I made sure my brothers got to school okay I tried to go to school when i could which wasnt very often because Mum was always so drugged up on anything she could get her hands on I was scared she d die in her sleep She slept all day and all night and only got up for like an hour or two in the evening to give us a can of spaghetti to share between the three of us and wine for herself This when on till I was about or I was beaten by my Pa every day always starving and making sure Mum didnt die in her sleep One day she went missing for over a week and while she was gone and my brothers and I were taken from our home into emergency foster care I assumed the school and neighbours notified the authorities about us being alone with our Pa because of how abusive he was Anyway we were there for two weeks before they found our Mum at some randoms dudes place all beaten and drugged up We had to go see her in hospital and it was pretty scary Ive never seen someone so yellow before I didnt know skin could be that colour Skip a few years and we are still in foster care and Im trying to get my life together I start going back to school even though I wasnt welcome there by teachers or students I got bullied by both all the time and it pretty awful I think the worst time was when I was trying to eat my lunch a block or two away from the school because I was too scared to be near people but some boys stalked me and beat me They kicked me in the chest and it was so hard to breathe and when I told the teachers they told me I shouldnt of been off school property Well fuck my bad Anyway when I was our government case worker found my Dad in another state and sent my younger brothers and I to live with him his new wife and two little girls I was pretty happy to finally feel like maybe I had a second chance at family but that didnt turn out so well In my short months of living there I was beaten by my step mum bullied even worse at my new school and was on watch by my parents because for some reason I was the devils child and couldnt be trusted This was about the time a girl I knew at school who I sorta considered to be my first friend told me that her boyfriend was cutting himself and she showed me pictures I asked her how he did it and she told me he could get razors out of pencil sharpeners That thought really scared me and I found it pretty gross A few weeks pass and my step mother was yelling at me because Im just like my mother and Im useless to everyone and I thought about the self harming my friend told me When she left the room I sat on my couch and cried for hours frantically trying to get this razor out of a pencil sharpener and I didnt know how It really infuriated me so i stomped on it till i got it out I dont know what came over me but I just started cutting All down my thighs and my right wrist I stopped when I realised that if anyone found out then I could be in more trouble A few days go by and im doing the night dishes and my step mother bursts into the kitchen and starts grilling me about not using colour coated pegs to hang the washing yeah she was OCD as fuck and I got really angry and waved my arms at her and told her she s nuts This revealed my cutting on my wrists though and when she noticed them she immediately grabbed my arm that was covered in cuts and dragged me to see my father They both started telling me that it was unacceptable and theyre both extremely disappointed in me I got my phone taken away for months and no computer use for a year I went back into my room and just sobbed my eyes out Thankfully through the government system I was seeing a counsellor and I told her what had happened and the next day I was out of my Dads care I had a boyfriend at the time who i only just met but his Mum was nice enough to let me stay with her till I got my own place My two brothers stayed in my Dads care for a while but were sent back to the state we originally came from because they didnt want them anymore I stayed with my boyfriends mum for about a year till I was and could live in student accommodation for school My schooling never really improved and I was diagnosed with depression and social anxiety during this time and kept to myself a lot It wasnt until I was that I sort of made a couple of friends through my boyfriend and school that I felt a little happier However my boyfriend cheated on me after a couple of years of dating and that put me into a whole new hole of depression I started self harming again and drank every cheap night I could out in town and slept with pretty much anyone because I wanted to feel wanted by someone Even if it was for a night I wanted to feel like I was something to someone This went on till I was with a couple of boyfriends in between and I left school to find a job and also I moved into a shared home to make it easier to start saving and have more money to buy things I wanted I also adopted a cat during this time and was actually pretty happy Unfortunately i had little contact with my brothers and foster carers but I was getting my life on track and it was good I was working two jobs at one point in a restaurant and a nightclub I really loved it One night at the night club a man asked for my number since it was his st birthday and I dont believe in love at first sight but I just knew he was the one for me I gave him my number and we instantly fell in love I could write forever about how much I adore this man but Ive already said so much and Im sure no one has read this far anyway But I loved him so much I saw our entire future together and I didnt see myself alive past but with him I saw forever We saw each other every weekend and went through a lot of anazing times togethers but like all relationships we had our rough patches He had severe anxiety and I thought I was over mine so I gave him my all to get him the support he needed to get through his but he was stuck in his own dark cloud of anxiety and nothing could get him out of it We dated for almost a year but that last few months were torture He was so depressed but not suicidal thankfully and always so anxious I gave him anything he needed or wanted and I forgot to take care of myself My depression was creeping back and my anxiety flared up whenever we were together We decided it was best we went our own ways to get ourselves back to who we once were when we first fell in love I dont deny we are out of love now but we dont speak as often as we use to and its still hard to see him pop up on my newsfeed every now and then After that my depression was creeping anymore and it crashed on me like a tonne of bricks My anxiety turned into full on panic attacks and I started feeling extremely suicidal One night I was just at home distracting myself with a video game and my roommate forced himself into my room and started yelling at me for something I dont remember what it was but next thing I know I was running down the street and I ran for about or kms till I came to a bridge This bridge was over water and i stared at it sobbing from the bottom of the walk way It was like am and for some reason I couldnt control my own body or mind I climbed to the highest point of the bridge and called my recent ex boyfriend but he didnt answer I tried to call him times before I gave up and sent him a really long message about how much I love him and not to blame himself for what Im about to do He didnt respond and I remember taking my shoes off turning off my phone and putting into my left shoe and my wallet into my right shoe I climed over the railing and I suddenly felt happiness I laughed so much and could feel the cold wind against my fingers and toes and just felt relieved I knew I was going to die and I was happy But someone who I guess was a late night runner grabbed me under my arms and used all his strength to slide me back over the railing It hurt like hell i thought my back was going to break Next thing I know I woke up in hospital and I was scared I was in a huge as fuck room with just cold toast and juice beside me and my belongings next to them I grabbed my phone and had a text from my ex He told me the hospital tried to contact him because he was my only emergency contact but ge couldnt see me in hospital because it would crush him to see me how I was I begged him to come but he wouldnt No one came No one from work called to see if I was okay or my housemates I had to stay there for two weeks and it was fucking boring and scary at times Thankfully I knew one of the guards there who I use to work with at the nightclub and he kept me company and snuck in food and gifts from outside We still keep in contact now but its hard to organise to see each other since we live in seperate states While I was in hospital I organised to move away I decided it was time for a change and away from this place so two days out of hospital I had everything organised and moved to another state A guy i met through playing games gave me his couch to crash on till I could find work and my own place It wasnt long till things went sour I told no one I moved away and when people found out they were pretty pissed and dont talk to me now and if they do its because its a pity check up The guy i was living with raped me and said I owed him this because I was staying at his house free of charge It took a long time to find a job and i found one in a cafe close by but as soon as I was alone I left that house and was homeless for a couple of days till I found a shared rental with some really nice people But my job was now two hours away and only casual so it wasnt worth the trams and buses for maybe a shift or two a week So i quit and lived off government payments I also broke my arm as well so finding work was really hard I also got back in touch with Mum because we were in the same state and I was hoping she was doing okay She wasnt but she was trying to get better so I offered to help She informed me by Pa had died thankfully and she was waiting on his inheritance so she could start her life fresh and I was pretty proud of that She needed a change as much as me and even though she was a pretty crap Mum when I was younger I wanted to give her a second chance When my arm was better I scored a job in a call centre that Im still doing now and its really stressful but Im not face to face with customers and that makes me pretty happy My mum got her inheritance and offered me grand to help set me up in my own rental so I dont have to couch surf anymore I declinded every time she offered because Im really independent abnd hate hand outs but she insisted for a couple of months so I said yes and got myself set up in my own place Things were looking up My depression was still there but I was distracting myself with work and started seeing someone as well But my ex kept coming back into the picture saying how sorry he was and wanted to see me and all this crap and I fell for it but it did more harm to my mental health than good so I had to tell him I need to be alone Anyway my Mum insisted she d buy all my things and not worry about paying her back but I told her not to spend grand on me since I want to pay her back abd I only need the essentials like a fridge bed washing machine and kitchen utensils She agreed but a few weeks later when it all arrived at my house it was more than I asked for I told mum I dont need all this stuff and I cant afford to pay her back for this She insisted not to worry about it and just be a lady and get yourself set up I was really happy I finally had my own space and work was a good distraction and Mum was back in my life but coming to the last few months it has been hell Mum decided to sue me for all things she bought me because I havent paid her back yet and when I told her what I could afford to give her out of my budget that wasnt good enough so she told me I should kill myself and I wont be missed and she ll see me in court My work started cracking down on us and it was flaring up my anxiety my ex was still trying to be apart of my life and it was really hard to maintain friends here and also make new ones I was slowly becoming in debt due to my phone bill and my internet provider screwed me over too Financially Im not doing good at all Im constantly eating bad and my nice body I had before is turning into mush My boyfriend was complaining we arent having enough sex because Im too overwhelmed all the time and I was becoming distant I was also diagnosed with borderline personality disorder this year and that stresses me out a tonne So one day I just snapped My life isnt getting better in fact its getting worse and this is when the attempt came into place a couple of weeks ago If youre exhausted from reading all this then thats just about as exhausted I am all the time My life was a mess and no matter how much I try to turn it into good I get screwed over Some of you know I have a dog Eva I adopted her a few weeks prior to be in my loving animal family but shes extremely active and my depression over this last year hasnt been good for her or my home so I gave her to a friend at work and shes doing well Anyway I snapped I broke up with the guy i was seeing i deactivated my social medias and downed mg of valium and some alcohol I gave my cat a kiss and cuddle and let her outside and Eva stayed right by my side as I fell asleep on her tummy What I forgot until the next day is that when I was taking all the drugs I told a close friend at work what I was doing and he came over and saved me Im not sure why I told him but he said I wasnt making sense on the phone and I just fell asleep and knew something was wrong I woke up in his house all sweaty and my stomach was so sore Eva was at the end of the bed and he was in a chair beside the bed He told me everything that had happened and I apparently begged him not to take me to the hospital and so he just kept an eye on me instead During the last couple of weeks Ive been using my savings to a things Ive never done before before I try to kill myself again I told work I needed time off and went to a state ive been to a few times and saw a girlfriend I knew and had an amazing time with her I told her everything I did and she was happy I was trying to do nice things for myself to see that my life was worth living for I also saw my favourite band play live which was so fucking amazing I never felt so pumped about anything in my life before like that gig Ive upgraded my PC so its amazing now and Im going to give to a guy at work who loves gaming but needs a new PC and Ive given a lot of my savings to friends for christmas gifts I even gave my landlord some candles and chocolate Im really going to go ahead and do this again Im at peace After my pill o d attempt I didnt regret it and I wish it worked Im trying to go back to work so I can have a little extra money to send my brothers before I go and to the guy at work who was with me the night I o d Im not sure how long until I do this again

just at a loss So I m at a point where things in my life just seem to be way too ridiculous for me to make any sense of or control I am m and here s some backstory grew up well off but with a case of undiagnosed depression and one of those families that never owned up to just how dysfunctional it really was It was my senior year of high school when all the previously ignored shit finally hit the the proverbial fan though My father lost his job and my parents decided to split My family now just my mother me and two sisters went from living a living a comfortable lifestyle to just making ends meet We moved to a tiny house and my mom was forced to find a job to keep us afloat All throughout this process my depression and anxiety issues start coming to a head I would go to school and just have panic attacks and either just walk around the place aimlessly in a weird haze or skip school altogether to drink or do drugs Eventually I dropped out Ever since then things just got worse and worse I started getting into more serious drugs until I started using strong painkillers and heroin My mother kicked me out and I was forced to move in with my father who sort of lived with his friend My first night there he explains the reason for the divorce was that he explained to my mother that he was in fact a gay man and he couldn t go on living a lie I guess While it made sense and I WAS extremely sympathetic to his coming out I couldn t help but feel alienated and weirded out Also I never really had a great relationship with him in the first place He was never the typical dad and also had his bouts with alcoholism here and there and I honestly didn t really like him for that even in spite of viewing everything now through the lens of his coming out At this point I realized how depressed I was feeling really suicidal daily but I was able to curtail the self abusive thoughts through drugs and alcohol I just sort of did not give a fuck about anything anymore I guess I wasn t in school and couldn t hold down a job and this developed into tension between me my father and his friend Eventually we almost got into physical altercation so I peaced the fuck out of there and went from house to house living with my cousin and other relatives and eventually some girl I was sleeping with at the time One day my ex girlfriend got really concerned because of my depression and drug use and coerced me to check myself into the psych ward at a hospital I did I spend around a week there and they discharge me with an antidepressant perscription I continue to live with said girl whose family actually turns out to be really cool and supportive and things really start to improve for me mental health wise as I stay on the Zoloft I eventually land a job at a pizzeria so my mother decides it s cool if I come back home providing I pay rent I m psyched and things are pretty cool for a while I quit hard drugs and stop hanging out with wasteoids But my medication runs out after a month and I don t have health insurance cause we re poor now Anxiety comes back tenfold and I just cant take working at the stressful pizzeria anymore so I stop showing up I try to explain to my mother what s up with my depression and anxiety but she just doesnt get it and thinks I m a wimp She finally agrees to pay out of pocket for a psych appointment so I can get new perscriptions but does so grudgingly and always uses that to sort of hold over my head This was about a month ago My medication is about to run out again and I still cant find a new job Everyday my mother comes home from work pissed and apparently now I have until the second of November to give her rent money or she ll drop me off at the social services building She doesnt fuck around It s been months but I m starting to feel real self loathing again and I feel like the only option I really have is to just sorta check out or get into hard drugs again I realize that was a lot to read and yeah it does seem like the plot to a bad coming of age tale kind of thing or some shit but this is what s up for me right now I figured I d try to bounce this off of some complete strangers to see if there are any suggestions solutions to my bullshit other than self harm Anything in response is both unexpected and appreciated So yeah,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update",high

It gets worse beyond death y o divorced male here With one beautiful son and he s god sent That being said he is a real problem as I cannot handle the thoughts of how he will have to go through with life when I discharge a shotgun in my face I ve considered taking his life as well in order to spare him I am a completely and utterly hopeless romantic I married my ex wife after threatening to abort our child we had an abortion a year before we had our son The divorce and custody trials are still not over have lasted over years and has put me in debt to my family trust for over I met an absolutely beautiful and exquisite individual over a dating app about two months ago She fills me with joy and is the most remarkable woman I have ever met She gave many different types of messages over the past few weeks which have all been predominantly reassuring This week my emotions boiled over a bit and I told her how much I want to be with her Our phone call last night concluded with her telling me in essence that my emotional overflow has created a small rift between us and she is in need of the emotions to be removed from our equation I haven t slept all week as I ve felt like I ve been losing her due to the fact that I have baggage and am otherwise more invested in this than she is I ve looked all my life for someone like her I detest the concept of not putting all my eggs in one basket I ve already hooked up with someone else since I met her to do precisely this and I thought about her the entire time it made me hate myself and want to purify and thus has caused me to overextend my affection and quite honestly appear to not have all my ducks in a line in addition to how emotionally distraught I was in our most recent conversation I have a year degree and apply for better jobs on a daily basis but to no avail I am living in a high income area and am no better off than I was a decade ago I have a huge issue with capitalism and coming from both a conservative and military family am routinely crucified verbally for my lack of personal motivation to seek and act in ways that will project my son and I forward I have suffered from extreme depression since adolescence took every antidepressant available in high school and self medicated with marijuana for a decade I can t cope with my situation let alone another great romantic loss any more than I can cope with the fact that I ve never felt capable of overcoming the gravity of my emotions As a single parent with full custody options for seeking help are all but plentiful especially with an ex spouse eager to reverse the custody situation who also happens to be in very dire straits financially Assuming I am compromised enough to even consider the destruction of my life and even that of my sons to spare him pain my only real issue is with God As a frequent lucid dreamer and someone unable to recover from the daily perils of life through an inability to sleep without working through significant karmic events I routinely deal with the aftermath of sins such as murder am imprisoned or am otherwise finding myself in a deep state of isolated suffering when I dream I am very much aware of the fact that there exists a life in the ether and the truth is that my life in the ether is worse than it is in reality I hate God for the situation that planet earth is currently in and has been in for thousands of years I hate that I cannot be at peace having lived a life where I ve tried to be considerate of others and truly feel that there is no escape whether i commit suicide or not I ve felt this way for decades and I ve deteriorated to the point of complete anguish where I truly wish to destroy my life and the lives of others as I see the human struggle to be so fickle and grotesque my mind desires seeking the dark web to sign murder contracts and then as I let my thinking spiral I return to a state where I realize that I truly have no desire to hurt anyone but to completely erase all aspects of myself entirely No memories no essence no soul Total obliteration and liberation through the end of what has felt like truly a life of magnified suffering I don t know how to end this because again in my mind there is no end no matter what action I take but I m so sick and unorganized that it has effected each and every person involved in my life,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update, Seeking Help",high

"Hey. So life is pretty rough and has been getting progressively worse for the last 8 years. Lately I've been getting literally spirals from the moment I wake up to the moment I sleep. Every single day. It's causing so many issues for me to even function. I try coping mechanisms, deep breathing doesn't help. It's stopping me from doing anything creative... The finished project just ends up a disaster because I can't get into any kind of flow which only makes me belittle myself more. 
 
 Sadly I don't really have any support I can go to. I'm in therapy but sadly I can only have a session every few weeks. I don't have any friends or a family i can speak to. Meditation I try to get in when I can (I'm in a chaotic house with no privacy) it sometimes helps but usually the spiral over runs it and often the house is too loud. 
 
 I'm also unemployed with no money so getting out to get a coffee or something isn't an option. Walks in nature help but often the spirals come back the moment I get home. I would happily do them for longer but I'm worried it'll get to the expense of my daily life. 
 
 I'm spamming this group lately because I'm getting into these spirals and I don't know what else to do with that cursed mindset... It makes it worse anyway, but by the time I'm ready want to go to sleep my brain is going the ""just end it"" route really intensely every single day. I'm waking up and thinking here we go another day of this and I don't know how to make it better.",Miscellaneous,low

Nietzsche for the Interested and Depressed Let me begin by dispelling a common misconception Nietzsche is not a nihilist If you associate him with nihilism dear reader it may be easier for you to understand what I am about to say if you pretend that you have never heard the name of Friedrich Nietzsche I find that many individuals come to a point where they stop look around and realize that they are a mouse in a labyrinth hunting for cheese however not only do they seem to be losing the game but they don t quite see the point of even playing They find that everything around them is an false image So much phoniness surrounds them with no escape Then they look at themselves and find that they have nothing to live for Congratulations friend if this is you you have stumbled upon the dark truth of man You have made it half the way the way there but I feel you have one more conclusion to draw that will return purpose to your life Beginning with the arguments of Plato Socrates and other Greek philosophers the original purpose of man was to follow a telos a goal to seek the purest form of the self For these thinkers there was a pure form of justice of triangles of logic and of man that were concealed by images projected by the objects themselves and by culture and only through argumentation can one find these Forms in a sort of team effort This sort of thinking provides at the very least a basis for morals and is the foundation for the character we try to instill in children Remember even before you started school how your mothers tried to teach you to be honest and kind as though they were inherent characteristics of man Eventually people began to question the existence of these Forms such as Immanuel Kant Friedrich Nietzsche Joseph Conrad among others Each of them provided their alternatives to these forms Likewise you seeker of truth have found that the forms in and of themselves are lies and it is here you Nietzsche Conrad Holden Caufield and Hamlet have found common ground however it is time to move back from the abyss and find a role and participate in the grand play of this world Nietzsche provides a solution for this issue Beginning with the given that ALL morality is a fiction a construct of society rather than attempting to distinguish truth from fiction the distinction must be made between fiction and better fiction Fictions range from an appreciation of Mozart and the Golden Rule to playing hockey or going to the club But with no grounding for even this quest for fictions it begs the question Why bother with these fictions The answer is That is life A life consists of a collection of actions of doing of being of finding whatever interests you KNOWING THAT IT IS NOT TRUE Football for example consists men running about attempting to move a pigskin and tackling each other but millions of people have adopted this fiction and made the rules a part of their lives Conrad expresses the pursuit of better fictions as turning to work Work is any activity that produces a better understanding of the self and that provides joy While science has discovered that we are a bunch of atoms you can do nothing with that information Unless of course you are a biochemist I haven t expressed all that I would have liked due to homework that I ve been putting off please comment with questions comments hate love criticism and I will try to answer accordingly TL DR You may have realized that the truth is we are a bunch of atoms however the point of life is not necessarily to find truth but to find more ways to enjoy life and provide substance for it Look at Maximus Pryme comment for a more focused analysis of Nietzsche than my rambling essay,"Cause of Distress, Mental Distress, Positive Coping",medium

Stories of people mistaking me for adults Im quite big even though Im and from behind one could realisticly assume a late s early s man was standing in front of them This turns out to be really confusing for some people My dad and I were at a department store that was specialised for tech stuff and we were looking for a dongle for my macbook The store we were in was quite small and you had to squeeze between people most of the time this was pre corona As my dad and I were looking around I hear someone asking how much a terabyte cost Initially I just assumed a middle age man from his voice was asking an employee even if his question didnt exactly make sense hard disk or ssd presumably so I ignored him The guy repeated his question a few times but again I just assumed he was trying to get an employees attention and ignored him Now I was wearing a fluorescent shirt Mistake The employees also wore flourescent Eventually the guy got frustrated and tapped me on my shoulder How much does a terabyte cost Oh I dont work here I say revealing my baby face The confused look on the guys face was a sight to behold and he apologised for being rude We still laugh at this instance today even though its been a few months Never saw the guy again TLDR someone thought I was a store employee I was not My family were at a school function for my brother and at the end everyone went to dinner together For some context my hypersocial mom is friends with most of the parents and teachers present or should I say all of them The dinner starts it was all you can eat and some of the parents start walking around offering wine to other parents its kind of their thing they drink a lot Of course they arent exactly daft enough to offer alcohol to the students Eventually they come round to our table and someone taps my shoulder quite obviously talking to me would you like some wine I look around and the parent behind me burst out laughing They thought I was my dad in this story i was and roughly the same size as my dad My stature had struck again Maybe if they didnt drink so much they could have seen that I was my dad TLDR semi drunk parent thinks im my dad,"Cause of Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Mental Distress, Positive Coping",medium

Long story please read and comment I have been feeling extremely suicidal as of late to a degree where I now dream of all the possible ways to end it I typically dream of my old apartment building and jumping off of the pool deck on the top floor I have lost a lot of things in my life and I have struggled with a lot and I just don t have the strength anymore Back story follows I was born into a loving family a terrific father a loving mother and my older siblings and twin brother Well my father found out that my mother was an alcoholic who would drink incessantly and it didn t get this way until my older brother s drug problem started getting worse Well after my father begged my mother to stop time and time again he decided he had enough and when I was my dad left my mum turning her occasional drinking into incessant drinking My twin and I had to live with my alcoholic mother and did all of our lives and the drinking never stopped years after my father leaves my older brother dies of a drug overdose and this makes the already bad drinking into a horrible habit starting as early as or in the morning and being smashed by I didn t know that my mum was the way she was until about th grade I entered middle school a fat loser because I had no friends from trying to care for my mum who always told me she was sick Well I entered and was made fun of all the time for my ears which were a bit large for my head at the time I have since grown into them I was bullied at school and came home to be bullied by my mother and if I was lucky I would have dinner typically I only had breakfast because we had no money for lunch and I could have some bread for breakfast As the years passed the drinking became worse and in th and th grade I attempted suicide a few times not really sure how to actually end it Each attempt failed obviously and each time it angered my mum but we never got me help from the quack I was never diagnosed with depression which I knew I was depressed and we never did anything about my urge to kill myself In my sophomore year I met a girl I thought I loved The relationship was great at first sex all the time and worries later I had never been in a real relationship so I thought this was how it worked We had sex all day every day She was a year older than me so when she left for college things became a bit rocky and I wasn t stable enough to deal with it at the time Shit went downhill and we broke up a few times and eventually went on a break around Halloween time in It was on this break that I met the girl of my dreams It was at my friends birthday party whose birthday rests on Halloween We met up and I was absolutely blown away by how unbelievably beautiful she was We began talking and we had interests in the same bands the same way of thinking the same type of humor We had a blast that night and we flirted cuddled and ALMOST kissed but I realized that would probably be in poor taste Y see my ex the one who said we should take a break never actually broke up with me she only said we should be distant for a bit not that we are broken up so I felt really guilty about everything I had done with this amazing girl who we will call Jill I couldn t confess to Jill what I was thinking I was too scared and pathetic to do so so I broke ties with her Well I found out my ex was fucking a lot of other guys AFTER telling her about Jill and her being pissed at me for even having had feelings for other girls Eventually the bitch ex and I break up and within two weeks Jill and I start dating Jill blew my mind every single day with how fantastic she was she was funny witty extremely smart and exceptionally beautiful I woke up every day and realized I have something worth living for now We were happy all the time and within a month I told her I love her and she said she loves me too that I am the most amazing person she has ever met in her life I was head over heels for her every day was fantastic because she existed in my life and every day was great despite all my other problems because in my life problems don t escape me Well about a month ago she dumped me because she didn t want to be tied down for the time and the shitty thing was I was going to propose in a few short months to be exact I know it is corny but I was going to surprise her at her college and find her in class or wherever and just kneel down and straight up propose to the girl of my dreams my soulmate if you will Well after she left I realized how bad my problems really are and how much worse things are getting now that I have put them on the backburner My debt for school is mounting ever higher and I don t know how to take care of it My college fund has been drained almost entirely and I failed two of my courses this past quarter because Jill dumped me and because I was terribly sick for a month Well I have to wait another months to take them again and I don t know what to do My mother is kicking me out because of my bitter mood even though I don t say a thing to her she also let me know that I am a loser who has done nothing with his life and fucked up the only job I had My Dad is breaking his back to help pay for school and because of my commute and the hours the schools have I can t get a job no one in my area will take on someone who can t even guarantee weekends I am not into drinking or doing drugs because of everything that has happened in my life and because my family obviously has a problem with addictions aunt is a drug addict grandma was too another aunt was also a drug addict My problem is this I have spent so much of my life in denial that now all the deck is stacked against me I have go to a school that I hate doing a major I despise and the college won t let me transfer about of my credits and I have no money to start fresh somewhere else My mother has slipped back into her old demonishing state where she lets me know everyday what I am doing wrong and won t let me stand up for myself My ex Jill is extremely happy now that we are broken up guys are constantly flirting with her on her page on facebook and constantly trying to hang out with her and none of my friends even give enough of a damn to call or ask me to hang out I have been strong my whole life dealing with my mother and having to take care of her and sacrificing my own personal life to make sure she doesn t fall down the stairs in a drunken stupor and get herself killed I was strong when my twin got into a car accident that almost killed him and I was strong when my twin decided to start drinking like my mum does My mum is clean now but she still abuses the fuck out of me and I can t be strong anymore Jill tells me she loves me that she wants to get back together someday because she sees me as her soulmate but I don t think I can just get better and not be sad about what she did to me I don t know what to do anymore I don t even remember what else I should put on here because there were so many problems in my life Please I need some advice I dream about killing myself every single night and all day every day I can t help but imagine how much better life would be without me being alive I daydream about my Jill being happy with everyone else and not caring about me anymore I don t get any support from my friends my dad tells me that I can t dwell on things and my brother would never understand The only person who does understand is my female friend who lives in Canada I am literally on the edge right now and I am so close to just ending it all and calling it quits Please I need some advice TL DR My life sucks my mother was an abusive alcoholic who wouldn t feed me for days at a time my father was never there because my mother wouldn t let him my brother took up drinking one of my older brothers died of a drug overdose I have no aspirations and no plan for a future and the only future I saw myself having walked out on me because she didn t want to be tied down right now I am on the

I know what I want in life but everyone is shitting on me So a few years ago I got into producing and recording music I was stuck in a college degree I have learned to hate not in US so I didn t have to take on huge amounts of debt so I decided to drop out eventhough the likelihood of having a six figure income in the future would have been pretty much amp if I continued Since then I have been doing pretty much nothing but producing recording and engineering music But everyone that knows about this says I should be realistic about what I want and get into a different field I have gotten so obsessed with music that I spent around hours days a week getting better and building a catalog Reality is though that nobody really gives a shit I only know a hand full of people that really listened to my music and they figured that I am not the average joe getting into this because they know how long I have been doing this and seen the extremely fast pace that I am progressing at In fact the first song I have ever written and played for a few friends not telling them at first that it was my own the reaction was OMG you wrote that song You have to become a pro musician after telling them the that I actually wrote it That s how I figured out that I have a talent for songwriting My biggest problem right now is my parents trying to force me into some field I really dont give a damn about I told them that in a few years I will commit suicide if I am not able to establish myself as a full time recording artist producer The more I think about it the more I actually consider following through if I don t make the cut What really fuels all of these thoughts is the nihilistic perspective that I developed I really believe this might be the one and only opportunity to do what you want Who knows what will happen after death My parents say that I am selfish for thinking about suicide and I told them that I never asked to be born and automatically sign a contract to serve everyone else s selfish desires I also know that I don t want any kids so that they don t have to go through the whole process The only circumstance that I would ever consider becoming a parent would be if I actually achieved my dream So I don t have to get at them with that oh sorry nobody told you that you are basically screwed when you are born you don t really have that many choices in life and only a few lucky people get to live their dreams So wo man up Just climb the corporate ladder I don t believe in that mentality Unless you are physically not viable for your dream e g being a model or an NBA player I really do believe in the harder you work the luckier you get I have visited a psychiatrist and the only thing that I got was a prescription for Zoloft which I learned has nasty side effects Basically they are telling me Well do whatever you want just take these pills so that you can accept the reality you were born in eventhough you know that you hate it and are just numbing yourself with these pills I have not taken a single pill and most likely won t ever do it TLDR Dropped out of college no debt and found out what I really want to do in life Already putting in ridiculous work hours into my passion Family and friends are suggesting to go into a different direction because be realistic I set a suicide date in the future if dreams don t work out Got a prescription for Zoloft to basically numb my true self because be realistic,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update",high

"chronic pains from chronic anxiety for the past few months iâ€™ve been dealing with chronic pain that seems to move around my body primarily in my feetâ€”especially the heelsâ€”and deep buttocks pain that feels like its within the bones they sometimes switch almost never at the same time 
 
 iâ€™ve undergone numerous doctor visits countless blood tests and several scans yet everything seems to check out okay healthwise a physical therapist ruled out fibromyalgia but suggested that the pain might be linked to chronic stress and anxiety
 
 adding to this ive been grappling with intense fatigue not sleepiness sporadically which complicates things further
 
 this has been an incredibly challenging journey especially because the pain persists and impacts my daily life making it difficult to walk at times its become evident that its not just physical its linked to my mental health however i have dealt well with my anxiety and do not have almost any anxiety feelings or symptomts for months now if anything the pains started after my month long anxiety flare up
 
 iâ€™m curious if anyone here has experienced something similarâ€”chronic pain seemingly from chronic anxiety or stressâ€”and if so how did you cope did you find any strategies that helped alleviate the pain or manage it better over time how long did it take and where were the pains exactly in your body 
 
 iâ€™m worried that the pains will never go away","Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Seeking Help",low

I was born a burdenI ve always felt like a burden Whether it be the medical bills to the food to the clothing I ve just always been a detriment to my family I don t live lavishly I let my sister and mother and father live the life they can Part of that life includes reminding me how much money I ve l c ost my parents My mother has always been this way and up until recently I had just had to deal with it I grew depressed and eventually turned to drugs and alcohol However I always kept a fine GPA and stayed in tune with what I was good with and kept working on my various side projects That became too much for me and I looked into moving in with my father for the time being due to the fact that my mother had become unbearable My father a much more timid spirit could continue to talk to me in a serious conversation instead of devolving from worried to screaming like my mother I ve gone to many different therapists to help with family problems depression and some mental troubles I was diagnosed with schizophrenia earlier last year and instead of helping me my parents decided it was in their better interests to ignore it and because of this I currently have to wake up in the morning and suffer every second while I m awake until I sleep which turns into a hour turn and toss fest until I wake up and don t have the will to try sleeping again To get to work and school my father helped me buy a car No longer can I tell if he continually reminds me of the car s price and how much he could ve done for himself with the money I want to pay him back as soon as possible but I am in no position to even start dealing with that matter My mother can t be trusted She goes out of her way to make my life harder She will call and text me every hours asking if I m available for dinner or some sort of meeting where when I decide to meet her she will spend as long as she can doing her best to remind me that she gave birth to me and it was the worst mistake in her entire life I no barely eat at this point because I m afraid to walk into the kitchen and make food out of ingredients I didn t purchase and I m barely making enough money to pay for school and gas as it is I cry on average or times a day but I think it s just a bad habit because I haven t gained anything from it yet I still consider suicide every day but it s not feasible when considering the position I am in It s selfish I read that suicide has a greater chance of hurting me long term over killing me If I attempt suicide I d probably mess it up and end up becoming a figure that sits in bed all day and drains my parents money on medical bills If I do somehow succeed with suicide my parents will end up having to pay my funeral expenses At this point in life I m slowly building up the money so I can safely move away and cut all contact with my family Maybe I won t be happy but they can be I m lost,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update",high

Correctable mistakes snowballed into something horrible I end up paying for mistakes I ve made or risks I ve taken in my life ten times over I might also seriously have the worst luck ever I ve looked into ending my life but it says in the sidebar we re not allowed to discuss methods so I ll leave it at that It s almost like I m just a normal person trapped in a very very abnormal life By the time I realized what was going on way too much time had passed So I ve started to formulate my exit plan I hope no one will judge me here My father is something I can t even say on here because I m too embarrassed to even say it You can use your imagination though I was severely neglected by mother she didn t even teach me how to read make a bed drive a car ride a bike my dad provided the bare basics and I learned everything else by trial and error or other people s parents As a child she would throw my shoes out the window No one but my dad knew no one would even think to ask about something so bizarre right She was really unstable and would have very public screaming fits on vacations I ve literally never seen anyone act as crazy as her not even the mentally ill homeless people you might run into like she would be on a small rowboat screaming that she wants to die on a lake for thousands of people to hear She s apparently been in this conditon since she was in elementary school but no one got her any help My mother would try to get into car accidents while I was in her car and I don t really feel safe in cars unless I m the one driving anymore She would sneak up behind me while I showered or hide in closets pretend to mishear me when I spoke and instigate hours long screaming fights like clockwork every time I went out with friends While I lived with her she would leave raw meat out on the counter over night maybe in the hopes I might get sick My mother s thought process is actually even scarier than the behavior that I ve briefly described When I have a migraine she will withhold medication for hours If I cough once she ll keep asking me if I m okay If I have a fever she d tell me I m lazy When I m healthy she screams in my face daily that I turned out poorly because she spoiled me too much even though I was so conscious of money that I wore kid s jackets in college to save money lived in a bedroom apartment with roommates have never been on vacation with her since I was even though she goes on vacation twice a year I know it sounds trivial but she literally can t go a day without putting someone down about what college they went to It s actually crazy though it s not snobbery it s like some really weird scary obsession unlike anything I ve ever seen She only sees people through this one label it s like they are not even humans at all She never listened to music read or did much of anything It s compensatory narcissism taken to the next level The only emotions I ve ever seen her express are rage and sadness and a weird flatness She sees people as superheros or peasants For a while she became obsessed with the idea that I wasn t allowed to do more than survive So I had to convince her human beings are meant to do more than survive This barely scratches the surface of my experiences I honestly should not have been born My life is such a nightmare I m not even human in the normal sense of the word My dad is also mentally ill vindictive and violent They are way more than mentally ill and abusive though They re incredibly similar to the weird neighbors in the movie American Beauty but within the disorienting gritty world of American Horror Story Honestly when that series came out I wondered if Ryan Murphy had been stalking me all these years I was a victim of severe gaslighting sexual physical emotional and verbal abuse What makes it such a trap is that they are basically outcasts so everything is totally weird the way they talk they never joke my dad knows like a total of a words they just don t have the social skills even the average person might have even our house was weird the cars they drove were weird But since they were in such reactive denial about it I could never fully come to terms with the truth So I was so brainwashed my own eyes would deceive me You might wonder how in the world I could stay in a situation like that right I think I m pretty submissive by nature and my parents hammered it into me I wasn t allowed want the stable lifestyle my friends had my life has literally been a prison where I took it for granted that I belonged in a completely different world than everyone else and that led me down a really dark path for absolutely no reason I did try to go college at first I had a dissociative disorder my whole life and my mother constantly sabotaged my college education so I could never get away successfully She manipulated me into applying to lower tier schools than I initially qualified for I still trusted her at that point I was so used to being gaslighted that I couldn t even think they were abusive until I had suffered another years with PTSD while trying to have a normal college experience having to put up with weekly screaming matches where I d be told I would never get a job and be exploited whenever I needed any money I had to move in with my mother to save money and escape but she was aware of my intentions and embarked on this terrifying extinction burst She contacted her doctor and tried to get me medicated self diagnosed me with mental illnesses and tried to get her employees to ambush me catch me off guard in the most vulnerable time of my life thousands of miles away from my support network and emotionally abuse me and completely erase my past They told me I had always been a difficult child that I had grown up a loner with no friends and that I needed anger management I was incredibly disoriented and felt like my whole life was being stolen from me I thought I was literally dead for a full year So I had a total breakdown had to try to heal in the midst of this twisted malicious intervention engineered by my mother who is actually the one who has always needed help since she was a child and I ve finally come out of that only to realize that I ve been screwed I don t know what to do My life isn t worth living I wasted so much time I planned on spending healing in order to fight this ridiculous war I totally should have seen coming but I honestly never thought she would take it this far and I m completely worn out I realize now I shouldn t have let it get to me but at the time I wasn t aware of triggers CPTSD narcissism and the way abuse works I was really naive and thought that everything was going to work out that my mother would get help and I might have the family I always wanted I don t need anyone anymore but nothing makes me happy I have no future I should have spent a lifetime focusing on myself instead of my mother She would literally try to interrupt me from studying establishing a social life improving my appearance being liked by other people and somehow find a way to make me feel crushing guilt about this on a minute by minute day by day year by year basis I think there is nothing left in me that can possibly try anymore I ve been crushed too many times and this last disaster with her has really destabilized my life I m so behind and isolated I don t think the people I used to know would even recognize what my life has become,"Cause of Distress, Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help",medium

Screenwriting Course Scripts and Characters that commit suicide and other parts of dealing with depression I ve been a little low lately so this matters to me I m long past the days where every moment feels like breathing underwater so it only hurts a little I wrote the outline for my script a year and a half ago when I was in the worst throws of my depression and was nearly hospitalized And now as I am in the class that comes after that basic course I have to finish the script I like how the script has grown and changed and it certainly has a broader scope than the depression that haunted me But today I had to write the little part where the character considers committing suicide It was like I was seeing myself doing his actions There is another character that is the voice of depression and every line I wrote was the ideas that I had in my head It was like writing down my thoughts from the past Too easy to write which meant I could zoom past it faster but I could never watch this script come to life It would be too traumatic I couldn t let other people see that too Especially people who know what its like I know it isn t the same now that I m much better but I feel like I could see myself cutting to stop myself from committing suicide or looking over the edge of a building sad that I was hesitating and that I wouldn t do it Confused if that was really what I wanted Another complexity I feel like I ve become the expert on suicide hospitalization therapy group therapy anti depressants and depression within my class Too many scripts don t get it right It s never as straightforward as they write it Even now it s not straightforward a part of me very small wants to kill myself A larger part of me wants to be off antidepressants even if it means that I fall back into depression An even larger part of me is ready to cut myself at a moment s notice to just stop pain And now I will talk about the script during class like opening up too much of a wound We will see how much it bothers me I don t think it will too much but who knows right Someone in my class wasn t clear about what the character was doing accident or attempt To me it sounded like a suicide attempt and if it is well I guess I ll have to tell her that there s no realistic way that she would get out of the hospital the same day Even if it is an accident someone would be asking her about her intent My life keeps getting more and more complex the farther I am from the epicenter of my depression Not that I don t have depression getting much closer to stable though I know this is long and I though this isn t entirely related But I just wanted to show this to people who know what it s like to consider suicide or know a bit about the ambiguity treatment and reactions that follow it,"Critical Risk, Progress Update",high

I ll explain a little emotionally unstable personality disorder hyper mobility syndrome ADHD attention deficit hyperactivity disorder My diagnoses mean that I really don t and cannot function normally I did for so long forcing everything into a bulging box taping it shut and hiding it under the bed Then I got made redundant from a job that I enjoyed and was good at Very good at It was a call centre admittedly but I really enjoyed it I made some brilliant friends including someone that ended up being my best man and I really do consider him a very good friend Through him I have met other friends plus someone who understands the shit that I am going through I ended up having to take a job that sucked A lot It was the beginning of the opening of that box It was slowly being pulled out from under the bed I was treated like shit I had no sick pay so when I needed the time off when I was having a bad MH day I was financially fucked I was working full time looking after my wife and we struggled a lot Not as bad as some but my god it was hard The job was complicated and my MH which we later worked out was my ADHD just compounded matters greatly I ended up getting another job HUZZAH It was in insurance which is something that I had done at my old job Private office Nice little family run business Annnnnnnnnnnd that s where we hit the snag I wasn t very good I wasn t expecting myself to hit the floor running but I hit the floor Hard I wasn t worried though I thought that I would be at least given training Which I really wasn t In anyway But I soldiered on for four days getting up a lot earlier than I normally would have mental health be damned The pay was so much better no shift work and I could get a bus all the way home meaning that no busy town no social interactions just iPod and a quiet journey home Then four days in the recruitment agency that contacted me initially called I was on the bus leaving town as I had to collect a parcel from one of those amazon thingies as I live in a flat and my wife s mobility isn t great and this was a iPhone so I wanted a secure place for it to go I updated my facebook status New job new me new beginnings Let s do this and let s get life back to what it should be feeling positive I got on the bus and my phone rang It was the recruiter and they had some concerns about my working there The owner wasn t happy that I was asking questions and that I wasn t as good as they expected Don t bother going back My heart stopped and I just didn t know what to do I started to cry but realised as a grown man I had to hold it together on the bus I started to catastrophise terrified I was going to lose my house my bills weren t going to get paid etc etc Then there was my wife What was I supposed to do I got home and tried to be pragmatic I applied for disability I couldn t cope with the prospect of looking for a job in anyway as I knew the box had been ripped open and all manners of hell had been unleashed Pandora had walked off with the proverbial butterfly that signified hope She had walked off crushing it in her palm Disability came through and I was ok for a little bit I ended up in hospital after an attempt but I was getting better day by day I applied for college am doing ok ish on my course I subsequently got diagnosed with ADHD and HMS shortly after and I am struggling but I am finding that some days I am falling under the water and cannot cope I am inflicting a lot of this on my wife being verbally abusive and quite frankly a total c nt I have been physically abusive to her in the past which I am in NO WAY proud of If I had my way before I would not be posting this and someone would have been scraping my remains off the ground floor of a story drop This brings us to now sorry if it seems a little patchy I just wanted to give a little context My OCD is at the point where I cannot stand waking up I struggle with even little things not working just the slightest imperfection in something and it must be rectified there and then It also has left me having to constantly check that I have everything Many times It leads to me being late for things and panicking like a bitch when I cannot find something My memory tends to feed the compulsions I skin pick I cut at spots scars anything that I deem unnecessary This was made very apparent to the disability assessor when I tried to explain things and just couldn t I was left in such a state after that assessment meeting I am so grateful for the person I saw for being so caring and understanding I have found that very little keeps me going at the moment I am trying so hard but cannot cope My HMS leads me to sometimes needing a walking stick It s embarrassing I want to end everything and just make this constant sensation of failure and hell end I have a wife I have an aunt with two little boys that think the world of me I have two best friends again with little ones that do the same I cannot forgive myself for thinking like this But equally I cannot cope with the way my brain is working I don t know what the future will hold I don t know what to do beyond hiding in my room with my laptop and my iPod trying to simulatenously distract myself from myself and hide myself from everything else Thanks for reading if you got this far just writing this down has helped me a teeny tiny bit,"Cause of Distress,

I think a restaurant I went to a year ago was sexist For context I m a male I went to this restaurant in my city for my aunt and uncle s wedding anniversary The food wasn t bad I had to go to the bathroom and this is February so pre virus restrictions There were three dudes waiting in line so I waited behind them The bathroom setup went like this There was a women s bathroom and an all gender bathroom I thought it was weird that there was no men s bathroom As I waited for the three dudes to finish up I think six or seven women passed me and used the bathroom in the women s room I got a peek inside the women s bathroom I didn t go in but from the view I got it looked like a nice and modern bathroom with two stalls a flower pot with fake flowers and mints Then the guy in front of me stepped out and I stepped into the all gender bathroom It was crap The tile had cracks and was crappy There was one toilet and a sink and the bathroom in general was dirty The broom and dustpan were still in there too The toilet had some scratches and so did the mirror The entire time as I sat there taking a dump I was thinking what the fuck The fact that the women got their own restroom which was nice and clean and had two stalls and the men were stuck with an all gender bathroom which was crap just pissed me off so much If I m being sexist let me know but I just think this is outrageous this is unfair,Maladaptive Coping,medium

I need to get this out of my chest Well hello I don t even know how to start this post but I will try I have been lurking this sub for some months now it has helped me a lot to forget about my situation but I can t keep running from this and I really don t have anyone to talk about this so I m going to try and vent a little in here and maybe it ll manage to be therapeutic Everything started a few years ago and I don t want to bore you with all the details about my life those are more suited for a psychologist but the gist of it is that I have always been hated all my friends tend to treat me like trash and even some teachers and family members did this so I started to become a cynic while I got left out and started to live life in solitude All of this didn t really bother me it was so typical that I just started to normalize it until eventually I became very depressed Alone and with no one to trust everything started to fall down on me my life broke apart and I desperately tried to cling to something to keep finding meaning a reason to live the sad thing is that all of that wasn t the tip of the iceberg I just kept holding on trying to be strong only to be met by weakness It started to get worse as I entered High school everyone found groups meaning something while I got left out once again Eventually I managed to find some friends that still treated me horrible they hit me and verbally abuse me I kind of drifted apart from them as the year started but the pandemic happened I went inside my house I stopped seeing people they stopped talking to me on a regular basis and I just got left alone once again At first it wasn t hard but life kept on going strong with me time and time again it kept dealing low blows the months kept advancing and I just felt like I was stuck in a blurry mist where everything just sucked We fast forward a bit probably around months or so where I started to show symptoms of a disease called APL I don t want to enter to much detail but basically I get micro infarcts in my brain and it s practically a miracle that I haven t lost my speech ability or my walking ability It s just random anything could happen ranging from hallucinations to turning into a vegetable And well I got diagnosed weeks ago my life style had to change and I lost the few things that helped me hold on to life those little hobbies that helped me escape for a few moments from reality they are just gone now and I don t have a clear picture any longer of how to keep going The weird thing is that I m not scared probably the only thing preventing me from ending it all is my stubbornness to admit defeat against a life that put plenty of cards against me So that s why I m writing this essay here today I just felt like no one could help me anymore so I m relying in complete strangers to help me grasp my new reality and well yeah keep on going Maybe this isn t the right community to write this but I just hope that I can find some way to find meaning to life And well if you managed to get here and didn t get bored with my life I thank you for reading me I know it doesn t mean much coming from a complete stranger but I can t offer anything else so sorry so yeah this is the post I hope I can some day find something but until then I guess I m going to just say goodbye and thank you Thanks for coming to my ted talk,"Cause of Distress, Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help",medium
Not really suicidal just depressed For a while a couple of years I have been getting more and more depressed However I m very good at hiding it so the only people who know are my close friends who cared enough to listen to my stoned rants about how shitty my life is Actually that s not true My life is great compared to a lot of people my family rocks I have a decent amount of money I m in college and good friends But there is one thing that has been missing from my life a relationship I m basically your generic nerd redditor who has never had any intimate encounter with a girl I m now and it s awkward to admit I have a girl I kind of like who I work with but she s from Nepal and has a boyfriend so I pretty much have no hopes I really want to tell my parents how depressed and lonely I am but I don t want to worry about me and spend tons of money on a therapist They have enough worries without worrying about me I know they would give me all the help in the world but I just can t bring myself to telling them about it Every time my Mom randomly asks Are you O K I think for a second to say no and tell her everything But instead I smile say Of course Mom and move on with my life Anyways I just wanted to vent here because I know the people here will listen It actually really helps to type out my feelings like this,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk",high

I am scared shitless of schizophreniaFirst off I d like to apologize for the wall of text You can skip most of it up until the tl dr mark without missing much Secondly I d like to thank you for giving a shit about a complete stranger on the internet You guys often do a thankless job but I love every single one of you It all started years ago when I was I began experiencing unhealthy amounts of anxiety in social situations my grades were failing and I ended up with a mild form of depression The only thing I looked forward to was coming back home to play video games I shrugged it off as a temporary problem that would go away on it s own but as the years went by more symptoms added themselves into the mix as the old ones became even more obvious I had less and less motivation to do anything I began having more and more suicidal ideations I stopped taking care of my body wouldn t shower shave brush my teeth or put day clothes on except if I had to get out of the house which was rare My parents initially thinking I was just being lazy eventually changed their minds and became very supportive of my troubles They took me to a psychiatrist Here s where it gets confusing He diagnoses me with some form of schizophrenia and immediately puts me on an anti psychotic Risperdal mg day Heart problems massive weight gain pounds in a month panic attacks extreme drowsiness It didn t seem worth it considering this type of AP does nothing to suppress negative symptoms I keep pestering him about the side effects until he finally decides to switch my medication to Abilify another AP that causes me very similar issues He seemed puzzled by all this told me he s never had a patient feel drowsy on a low dosage of Abilify and concluded that I might very well be causing those side effects to myself that if he was to give me a placebo and convince me that it was an anti psychotic I would feel all this He urges me to keep taking an anti psychotic any anti psychotic Fast forward a month or two of switching between the two meds and finding both of them unbearable I tell him I stopped taking them I beg him to reconsider his diagnosis of schizophrenia that maybe the medication isn t doing anything good because I am not psychotic He redirects me to a psychologist who makes me take a Rorschach and a Thematic Apperception Test The guy concludes that I scored like a schizophrenic would and that it was indeed very important that I take my medication without which I could have a psychotic breakdown at any time I think that s the point where I realized I was massively fucked Up until then I managed to tell myself that this schizophrenia diagnosis was just a joke I would play along with on the off chance it was true but somehow having those test results explained to me made the threat very real I ended up doing a lot of research on schizophrenia and apparently every psychotic breakdown will rot your brain from the inside Lowers your cognitive functions including your intelligence every single time No amount of medication or therapy can ever fix the damage done tl dr I attempted suicide a few months back after realizing what fate had in store for me by overdosing on my medication Since then I feel like a piece of shit because my mother is terrified of losing me and has told me on multiple occasions that if I go she goes I don t want to turn into a fucking vegetable I don t want to lose grip on reality I d rather not exist and the only thing keeping me alive right now is knowing that I would hurt my family even more than I m doing now by being a useless fuckup but that last resort is now being tested After visiting a day hospital for group activities the psychiatrist in charge spent half an hour explaining to me just how I m a ticking time bomb who s going to lose control I don t know if you guys can wrap your head around the concept of losing the essence of what makes you a person but it s very very scary I would much MUCH rather die I don t want this piece of shit schizophrenia I ve never had a hallucination in my damn life I consider myself a rationalist and a skeptic I ve never had funky beliefs or delusions I don t do drugs nobody in my family has schizophrenia I never expected I d have to deal with this one day I want to fucking die It s all I think about I can t take a bath without wanting to drown I can t be in a car without thinking of jumping out I keep spontaneously coming up with ideas on how I should end myself H S hypothermia shotgun hanging drug overdose and alcohol I feel like shit I don t want to see myself becoming insane As of today nothing not even their precious anti psychotics can guarantee that I won t slip up at one point in my life To sum up my current situation one of my doctors told me that if we liken someone s personality to a crystal mine is cracked It s not broken yet but the smallest event could destroy it and there s no way to fix it I m sorry if this is difficult to read I haven t had much sleep and I feel like absolute shit,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update",high
Could this be considered an attempt I ll begin with that I am not currently depressed anxious nor receiving any kind of treatment However I often find myself reflecting on an event that took place about eight years ago At the time I was diagnosed having an anxiety disorder and likely depression Though I m not a physician I was reluctant to accept the doctors diagnoses of depression but having had a prior bout with anxiety I began treatment for both In time and under medical supervision I was eventually permitted to cease treatment Some time later I went though a period of limited and difficult sleep Sleep has been an issue for me since early adolescence One night after about hours of sleeplessness I had become so desperate and exhausted that all I wanted all I could think about was sleeping I took a handful of pills muscle relaxers a couple of different narcotic pain killers and diphenhydramine Probably around pills total washed down with about half bottle of liquor The drowsy feeling I had been seeking was upon me in short order Before surrendering to sleep a though crossed my mind It may have been too many pills to much liquor I had my phone by my bed and two flatmates within earshot I didn t care I just wanted to sleep and soon I would be I awoke about a day later with evidence that I had pissed myself sometime during my drug enabled sleep I did not actively seek to end my life however for that brief moment before surrendering to sleep I was honestly indifferent about ever waking up I ve not since found myself in such circumstances and have been mostly happy for the greater part of the past decade but I often think about that night and wonder how to classify it I ve never spoken to anyone about it and this is the first time it has even been externalized put to paper computer screen TLDR Couldn t sleep Took a lot of pills and booze Before passing out honestly thought it may have been too much but I didn t care Help was readily available just needed to shout for one of my mates thin walls or could have used the phone sitting right next to me Wasn t trying to kill myself but I didn t care if I never woke up,"Critical Risk, Progress Update, Seeking Help",high

TrappedHello to anyone so kind as to read this and listen to my troubles You are truly a wonder to hear out any suicidal person I m at the end of my rope Severe depression and anxiety have plagued me since I was and I am now Grew up in an abusive home and developed agoraphobia that in tandem with my other mental illnesses rules my life To give an idea of how bad my anxiety is I failed classes because I was too scared to leave my seat to turn in my work I was living for my childhood cat until she died a year and a half ago an event I had long figured would mark my demise I was ready to kill myself shortly after her passing but in the days I spent in preparation I met an amazing person who is still my boyfriend I get by for a year with a lot of his help but then lose my job That was six months ago I move in with my boyfriend We have horrid upstairs neighbors that consistently deprive me of sleep insomnia is was already an issue so before I know it my days become entirely comprised of doing nothing but trying to sleep I m scared to leave the house but so miserable and constantly incredibly stressed out from the neighbors that I feel completely trapped I fear that dying is the only way out I moved back in with my mom briefly but not having the daily companionship of my boyfriend saw my mental state unravel even worse than what the neighbors do to it I would love to just run away and live in my car was homeless once but I m dependent upon both my medication and unfortunately opiates The opiates are to counteract a horrible thing called akathisia I already tried killing myself due to this wretched disorder twice until opiates brought miraculous relief though they re obviously a double edged sword I can t get off my meds either as that would undoubtedly end in suicide after experiencing my depression unleashed again So I m stuck with no job a home I despise but am too scared to ever leave a substance dependence that won t allow me any freedom that I m not too afraid of and zero future prospects And this is a very general list If I listed everything that is wrong in my head and my life this post would be even more lengthy I don t want to hurt my boyfriend or any of my family but I can t keep this life up I thought I could get through today as long as I got to spend time with my boyfriend but after waiting all week an agonizing amount of time when you are desperate to die he came home with a headache and had to go straight to bed He works long tomorrow I really don t think I can t make it another day,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Seeking Help",high

Could anyone give me advice I ve had psychological problems for as long as I can remember and I ve reached out for help so many times but no matter what I do nothing changes The first few times I asked for help I told my parent I was depressed This was when I was barely a teenager and she just did the normal parent thing of saying What do you have to be depressed about Then a few years later I started self harming and not attending school My school made me see a psychologist for low attendance but they said I was fine My Mother told them about my self harming which I m sure they already knew about if and this psychologist said it s just trendy and that her son does it because he s a Goth Those words makes me cringe to this day My Mother took me to my GP anyway and they refused me to refer me to any mental health service and gave me a leaflet for a mental health service of which I was not within the age range I later dropped out of school I started drinking to deal with it then having strange symptoms derealisation depersonalisation I was having panic attacks multiple times everyday and completely socially isolates myself for a few years I felt terrible all the time and was deeply disturbed by my thoughts When things got a little better I decided to go back to school as I had no qualifications and went on to study a course which could get me into University studying a science related degree I found the work stupidly easy and went through with good grades By the time I was on my last year my mental health was deteriorating quickly I could no longer concentrate or function at school or in any other area of my life I went to my GP and they asked me some irrelevant questions about my Father none about my symptoms apart from weight loss gain and sleep Then refused to give me SSRI s I went home and some time later my memory is a blur I tried to kill myself I ve now had two serious attempts at taking my life and I m positive there s no way for me to get help but if I don t get help soon I know I m going to try again And I know it will likely work this time I ve tried to get help so many times I can t even leave my house anymore I don t know what to do Nobody is taking me seriously and I have no idea what s wrong with me How can I get help I ve even tried reaching out to people working in the NHS Nothing comes of it I have people who depend on me and I don t want to put my potential to waste but I m running out of time and I ve tried everything I can I don t even have the emotional energy anymore I m not scared of dying and the idea is quite appealing to me regardless of my mental state so if it happens it happens I have multiple mental health problems as well as sensory processing problems relating to a neurodevelopment disorder I have and just existing is torture to me Even when my mental health is okay I want the suffering to end I m so so tired I just need to know that I tried for the people I care about and my own philosophical reasons And I would do anything in my power to turn this situation around If anyone can offer any advice to me then please leave a comment Anything you have to say will be helpful to me,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update, Seeking Help",high
