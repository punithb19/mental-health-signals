{"post": "I do not know what to say.I have been suicidal pretty much since the start of my teenage years. I do not know if I have depression or not but suicide is the only thing I am able to think about. I have fun with my friends and I think they like me too and I am dating a beautiful girl.I feel like I should be thankful for all I have but all I can think about is ending my life. My left arm has self harm scars that I have subconsciously trained myself to hide.I have scanned online forums for methods and now I find myself adding materials for my chosen method to my Amazon cart.I have had a desire to exit that has only grown with time. Was committing suicide at a young age my only purpose on this earth? Anyone feel like committing suicide is their only purpose in life?"}

{"post": "To the one quietly contemplating what he would miss I was like you once I had no vision of any overseable future I was blind to life and what it presented me with I was depressed and apathic nihilisticly searching for a way out I went through the motions every day I forced myself out of bed in the morning Usually i overslept with a few hours but luckily very few people could step into my shoes at work so it was tolerated I went to work and collapsed on the bed when i got home I saw no point in the totality of my neverchanging excistence and i wanted to die I wanted cancer i wanted it to end And at the strangest times your wish is often granted A day at the doctor reveiled an abnormality in a lymphenode I was admitted to the cancer treatment hospital for an operation and released a few days later Nothing to write home about really but my belief in a pointless existence had been rocked as i started to realize id be dead at the age of if this was a hundred maybe even years ago Contemplating these things i started with time to realize id actually miss the small things in life if i died I would never have felt the sun on my face again the wind pulling at my clothes The snowstorms chilling my bones and stabbing my cheeks I would never again have eaten a pancake with shugar Never smelt the clean air after a thunderstorm Id never again see a lovely girl walking in a bikini at the beach Never again hear the birds chitter over the mountain stream quietly dancing through the meadows And so these thoughts started to condense and i came to the conclusion that the things i would miss were not specific to say the pancake I would miss the very basic action The seeing hearing feeling tasting and smelling I would miss my senses And thus i knew why i was alive I knew the essence of my existence With this epiphany a new kind of sense came into being a combination of them all It can be described as nothing else than The experience I could suddenly stop when it came over me and just be Just feel the experience of receiving input through the senses It was exhilarating Sitting on a bench in a town square Riding a roller coaster walking in the woods All the things that would challenge my senses and push them further than before And my wish for death slowly started to melt away But wishes granted are often granted with a two barreled shotgun to use a different cliche than the double edged sword one The cancer of course was back and got a real grip this time I was granted my wish and i could never take it back I was admitted again the same day it was discovered and scheduled for a hour open surgery the next day After not eating for a day and drinking lots of foul tasting bowel emptying juices the surgeon came to see me to explain what he was going to do They were going to go inn through my stomach muscles up under the rib cage and remove of the worst affected lymphnodes in my thorax I was given a pill to daze me for insertion of some kind of coma inducing dripper into my spine I believe coma is preferred during these operations over drugs that shut down your nerves I dont even remember counting backwards before the void claimed me for the first time And then my world exploded I was wide open from my pelvis to my ribcage I was mangled and the pain was like a perfect storm The one that lifts you off your feet and slams you into the wall The one that rips trees from the ground and grinds your very soul to cinders I was dying and it couldnt come fast enough Two hands appeared at my side They were female and very pretty The nails were cut short and had no nailpolish They were covered in a brownish residue The skin was smooth but the folds around the joints were prominient It was the hands of a year old woman It never occurred to me to look up All that existed through the storm where those hands and the needle they were injecting into a plastic tube hanging next to my head And so i vanished into the darkness and hoped i would not remember this where i was going next I was floating in nothing and there was something familiar with the interruptions in my existence Sounds it had been called Voices dawned on me and i knew that was it Far away voices were talking A male and a female It was crude and gutteral Ugly cracks in silence I shut them out and the void reclaimed me to take me to my next existence There is something strangling me I realized waking up I wanted to tell the voices but i couldnt speak I wanted to wave to get their attention but i couldnt move I had no influence on this world I was a rock drowning in a river I was alone A constant high pitched tone started up in the distance The current swept me away and the void reclaimed me to take me to my next existence This one will be better i thought and decided try life again Are you ok Someone asked me I was in the recovery ward and the storm had abated I still couldnt move but i was able to open my eyes This is progress i remember thinking I am luckier than the last time i lived After recovering from the operation i was placed on a chemo therapy that lasted for months At the start i thought nothing much of it but i soon deteriorated into a quivering shadow of what i once was I was hooked up to the rat poison every weekday but the Thursdays were the worst Two nurses and a doctor usually came visiting with a bag wrapped in aluminium foil carried on a tray They were all wearing gloves and masks Thursdays i wanted to live more than any other day of the week I used to love the nights back then I do to this day actually They were free of the poison and it was bliss All the tubes and wires were disconnected and i felt like pinochio turning into a real boy If i was drugged enough i could almost remember being alive I could almost remember that i once could walk for a mile That i could laugh and run jump and climb a tree Almost alive somewhere There was a room on the ninth floor with some couches chairs and a tv where four patients used to sit and not talk The tv was never on They would stare at me and nod when i entered but never say anything I dont think they even knew each others names But they seemed as close as any friends could ever get I enjoyed their company even though they were years older than me Age didnt seem to matter we were all here and there was nothing to say I started to frequent this room more and more as time passed Everywhere else there were people wanting to talk or look encourage or pity It was disgusting and I hated them all About weeks had passed and a blessed night came again I quietly walked through the corridors until a man came up to me It was the first male nurse i had seen since i was admitted I hadnt thought of it before but this work place was really dominated by women He had made me cereal with milk one of the few things i could swallow without puking back up There is plenty of shugar he said smiling as he handed me the bowl Not waiting for a thank you he turned and left He d seen the night walkers before and knew what was coming The bowl was heavy and i knew i couldnt carry it far so i headed for the stairs leading up to the th floor At the first step i knew i wouldnt be able to climb them this night I had always liked sitting in stairs for some reason and found a sort of poetic beauty in having this meal here The stone was cold and i sat down with the bowl in my lap I had to spent a few moments getting my breath back Being able to bend down to sit is something you might not cherish But once you loose it you realize its immense value Dark empty halls seemed to stretch for an eternity Nothing outside mattered or was even real anymore These halls were the world i knew now the foundation of my existence I started eating my cereals letting go of one piece of my past for each bite Grinding the memories as i chewed Chomp i was climbing in a tree I could see to the end of the world i could climb into the sky Chomp i was on a swing with Eve We were weightless we were flying She was laughing and i shared in her laughter Chomp i was riding a bike I was going faster than i had ever thought possible No runner could ever catch up with me Chomp I was walking to school I was curious of what would come Excited of what we would learn Chomp I was landing my first heelflip on a skateboard I was proud i was admired by others i was accepted Chomp I was riding a moped I could go wherever i wanted i was free Chomp I was running through the woods with an ag automatic rifle I was in a brotherhood I was defending a nation Chomp I was at a party talking to Kristin I was in love Tears started streaming down my face as she vanished but there was no going back and i continued eating Chomp I was on extacy at a rave The beats vibrated through the air that surrounded me I was a spiral galaxy i was dancing flame Chomp I was being told i had cancer I was speechless Chomp i was walking into a small room of people with strange eyes on the ninth floor I was missing something important Chomp I was handed a bowl of cereals from a smiling man I was grateful Chomp i was siting down on stone steps I was sitting Chomp i was eating cereal I was eating Chomp i am chewing I am the sum of my experiences and memories I am old My whole life had vanished as i finished my last meal A calm feeling of being whole came over me and i was ready I sat the bowl down closed my eyes and then i died You cant sleep here the male nurse told me Your immune system is nonexistent and these steps are cold Lets get you back to bed And that is how my next existence started I was hollow for a long time after that It was like sensing through a veil Like listening to voices from under water Everything was far away and i was looking at reality from outside Time passed and i went again to the room on the ninth floor There were three now They nodded as i entered but seemed to look at me differently recognizing something And suddenly i saw what they had always said as it echoed in my mind We who are about to die salute you And they were right We were gladiators we were fighters and we had all been sentenced to die But each moment we had was a treasure more precious than any earthly riches We had nothing we could loose nothing we could want nothing that could ever be taken away from us Our life our thoughts our actions and opinions were no ones but our own By letting go of everything we had gained something new A new beginning where each experience is a separate existence Like an eternal supply of white paper and colored pencils We had gained life And so i write this post not only to free myself from previous battles and to wake again to a new existence But to tell you that in your next existence you will one day wake up and realize it is all better that today is a good day I promise"}

{"post": "Please help me make sense of my reality I don t know why I m writing this post except thatI m really really really in pain and on the verge of giving up I m years old I miss being myself being kind positive and bubbly I feel like the best parts of me are dead I also feel weak and fragile I grew up in a picture perfect family my dad was my best friend My biggest problem was losing weight and having a critical mom My parents had a great marriage my grandparents from my dad s side and from my mom s side were my biggest supporters I moved to a new country because my younger sister had autism spectrum disorder there was nothing in our country to support her so when I was my brother and my sister my mom left her job family and home to move to a developed country for my sister Apparently with therapy she could get better My dad remained back to work and support us abroad Financials this was when dad suddenly made it very big Also dad has a brother his wife my aunt and two children cousin is older than me and cousin is younger than my brother In the past year and a half these things have happened to me and these are the mistakes I made Dad started becoming distant Right after we left his mother conspired to get uncle to join my father s business uncle wasn t doing so well Mother was unhappy said she should just give him money Not have to work together As predicted by my mother and her mother fast forward years and Father is bankrupt with tonnes in the millions in debt that his brother took in his name Dad started a whole new business had everything on paper and handed it to uncle Slowly uncle got in more and more of his friends Father cannot and will not stand up to brother Every time he tries uncle calls his mother who calls my dad and psychologically abuses him SO much that my father gives in Father had to go to jail for a day for all this debt At one point dad was paying tuition for uncle s son while I was taking loans Extended family I grew up with as a result all hate dad now because he s not rich isn t giving them all free money owes them money Dad cheated on my mom this is ultimately what broke me in the years he had been away I watched their perfect beautiful marriage disintegrate Uncle and grandma probably really contributed to this I listened to mother cry on Skype for months like every other day straight What I would give to never have heard the stuff she said She read his text messages to other woman she also talked about her sexual life OMG She doesn t have many friends therapy is frowned upon in our culture so she cried to me And I listened Found out my grandfather dad s dad was a rapist He apparently approached my uncle s wife who then disconnected from my family As a result of which my grandma was so desperate for the two brothers to be working together Mom s mom is alone and struggling because she only had my mom and dad My dad hates her even though she tried to help him due to brainwashing from his own mother And my mother is incapable of being supportive so they have a conflict and I am stuck in between My mom s kidneys are not working like only percent so I ve been trying to convince her to take one of mine The constant implication is if she dies her two kids are my responsibility not her husbands My best friend who I was in love with broke up with his girlfriend And I took care of him We were pseudo dating everyone thought we were together I didn t want to push him because he just broke up RIGHT when my family fell apart he decides he met a girl in the library and loves her and they are dating He loves me but he loves her more because with me he does not feel carnal feelings I came to terms with the fact that I had been sexually assaulted as a child in my grandfather s house by a guy who worked there For years I kept thinking I wasn t pure and would never be enough for a guy A few days after this happened I think I was my grandmother mom s mom asked me if anyone had been near my vagina I said yes I don t know what she did after with this realization and the rejection I felt a lot of need to prove something to sex so I hooked up with guys and had sex with one off the internet He was nice and consensual made me feel good about myself but just dumped me as he got back with his girlfriend I started supporting myself more and more financially and it s been hard But I recognize it s worse for so many people TODAY haven t talked to dad properly in months I think he has PTSD cannot reconcile him and grandparents and uncle s family who loved me and supported me as a child Mom is dependant on me in some ways and its nice and suffocating I feel this weight on my shoulder of responsibility which I plan to take This is all that comes to mind I ve kept going because of good friends and this belief that if I keep working hard I ll get somewhere But recently my sister has been diagnosed with epilepsy and that made me so depressed As a child of immigrants I feel no identity Couldn t hold on to my religion lost all family back home don t fit in there when I go back home now the sexism pains and I feel like an outsider in my country where I ambling now which I feel will never accept me as me Please give me some perspective articles or tangible advice I m struggling so much SO MUCH TLDR Bankruptcy familial estrangement sexual assault sick mother infidelity in family heartbreak Identity crisis as an immigrant and a lot of pressure to take responsibility of siblings I m finding it difficult to keep going"}

It has been killing me all my life. It has affected my friends, my loved ones and myself. But you probably already know that\n \n What’s concerning me right now, is whether or not I can feel love. Right now, my girlfriend and I are on a one week break from one another. I’ve been what I fee is an emotionally abusive asshole towards her. Paranoid that she would cheat on me, that she would leave me. And before that, ever little thing I didn’t like that she did, set me off. When it shouldn’t have, and I know it shouldn’t have. But it did anyways. And it always hurt me later to think about it.\n \n My question is: can borderlines feel love? I feel like I’ve been such a manipulative piece of crap to her, and I just want to know if there’s even any hope. I don’t want to hurt her heart, she means so much to me but I’ve been such a douche to her. I stared self reflecting so much, asking why I even love her. If I even do. I cried so much thinking about her gone. The thought of not seeing her. Her smile gone, her heart to someone else. She can do as she pleases but it hurts me. Do I love what she’s done for me, or her as a person? How can I even tell? Is she better off without me? Can I fix us? Maybe I’m overthinking..\n \n I’m just so lost right now and would like some experiences and thoughts and advice, even. It hurts my chest and makes me cry and I’m desperate"}

Me and this girl have talked as friends everyday for 6 months been dating for 3, and it’s great overall I love her very much. \n \n With the new relationship ive found myself creeping into old thought patterns and codependency. I’ve never been to a psychiatrist or anything, just been obsessed with personal development since I was 14. It’s hard to deal with because logically she has done nothing to trigger these emotions.\n \n I thought I had these aspects of myself dealt with and released but there’s still more. I find myself worrying about every little change in energy or if she will just get bored and leave me. I feel as if I never do enough when I give my absolute all. It’s very confusing and I struggle on my end to not resent myself.\n \n I can’t afford going to therapy or anything but, I’m just wondering if anybody feels the same or has any advice. I really do love this woman and refuse to let bpd run me, it’s just so hard having the “flip” and spinning thoughts over nothing about someone you know cares about you."}

If they were a few years younger they would have got divorced, I am sure of it. There is no doubt in my mind that they do not love each other, or at least not anymore. Over really simple things they just yell at each other constantly, and recently its happened for four days straight, very long arguments.I absolutely hate it. It makes me cry away to my room and shut the door tight and put on headphones so I do not hear a word of what they are saying. I want nothing more than for them to stay together and not spilt up, for the sake of the family. If they divorce I do not know what side to take, but I know them well enough to tell that they will make me choose one.I am well aware that divorced parents is a very common thing. I always thought as a kid that there was no way your parents could ever not like each other, but clearly I was far from right. I recently have felt the urge to step in myself and just tell them both to shut up and get along, and have even considered buying flowers for my Mum and telling her it was my Dad so that they would hopefully calm down or something. It sucks, it really does. I just want them to like each other again. Hearing your parents fights everyday is just the worst."}

{"post": "I can t live with this thought I feel sick During last summer I developed a sense of high anxiety around being in the company of young people babies that I d never had prior This was a result of feeling intense distress over finding out that an ex teacher was a pedophile I came to realize in March this year through research that this is called POCD which provided me with a lot of relief In the late evening of Monday rd September after having moved back into university halls of residence for my second year a week prior I basically watched pornography for around about hours intermittently when my depression was as its worst height I d already experienced false memories by this point Anyway for that whole afternoon and night I would go from grinding humping against the bed an awkward way of doing it that I developed when I was in my early teens while watching Porn Hub on my phone to then sitting up and watching random videos on YouTube The second to last video I watched was a video of Kurt Cobain and his year old daughter that appeared on the homepage after going back from Porn Hub and sitting up in bed again At this point I remember thinking that if I were to watch this video I shouldn t watch another video afterwards purely because this YouTube video had a baby in it even though I knew deep down that the two videos were entirely separated by tabs on my phone not to mention obviously by content Nevertheless I watched the interview video scrolled through the comments and paused at a specific point then went back to Porn Hub and only then did I kneel down to grind the duvet again but with a video loaded Finally I remember sitting up again and going back to the YouTube homepage and the first video shown was a slideshow of Cobain s daughter through the years and I remember feeling so much guilt for having watched the prior porn The reason for this is that as best as I can describe seeing her as a baby the pinnacle of innocence exemplified the essential humanity that we all have including the adult performers As a result I felt heavy guilt that I now realize to be misplaced for being what I considered to be anti feminist and an evil person Perhaps I overthink the morality of things I don t know My brain at the time immediately started to go into overload and overlap what would otherwise be two separate actions of watching YouTube then lewd stuff I remember going to the sink afterwards and dry vomiting With regards to the actual first person recollection of possibly staring at the Cobain video I have no explicit sensory memory of this The image in my head is grainy at best I wouldn t have been able to live with myself were this the opposite After leaving the bathroom and panicking a lot I walked through it step by step and eventually felt comfortable enough that I hadn t done anything wrong and so I left it This as a general worry didn t reappear again till May with the rest of being spent going from day to day worries and false memories I even felt happy and content on New Year s Day this year Surely if I d done this horrible thing I wouldn t have been able to feel anything happy ever again At first I wondered if I did do it and I just repressed it or I didn t and actually it s just my overactive imagination mixed with my anxiety I know that in my heart I didn t do anything wrong as I had listened to Nirvana plenty of times afterwards and didn t feel pangs of guilt or shame that I know I would ve if I d done anything wrong Things have gotten better mildly My first appointment with an OCD therapist is soon I m currently on the fourth day of taking a beta blocker to regulate my heart rate and blood pressure that helps ward off the panic attacks I have about it I m trying to sleep better but sometimes the image creeps in too much I m due to get a new set of the anti depressant mirtazipine soon too But even with that it all feels like too much right now and I m more suicidal than ever about this I don t want to die over an image in my head but is this a belated guilty conscience I feel sick and can t think or sleep I have moments of you know you re being silly start living again but then it hits my head over and and I end up in bed depressed for another week I worry that I might out of a morbid curiosity have done it I remember faintly thinking how awful it would be to do it and then as far as I know not doing it"}

{"post": "*it was about time i put my feelings into words. I am so sick and tired of feeling this way, feeling like i will never be happy, like my life is going to waste, like i will never amount to anything. I am tired of holding myself down from experiencing life while it slowly slips away, while i slowly slip away from within my own reach. its so draining seeing everyone openly be themselves, having fun and enjoying their youth while i sit here and watch mine deteriorate right in front of my eyes. I am so tired of seeing people advance in life while i watch motionless. when will it ever be my time???????? i ask myself every day. when will it ever not be this way???? i drive myself insane while people continue to flourish in pure sanity. i want to get out, walk the streets confidently without having to hide every aspect of myself and my life. i want to feel comfortable in my own skin, my own body, my own life in which i have been precociously shrouded. i want to be able to feel life, what it really means, instead to living lifelessly. i want to do as my peers do. i want to be able to fit in. i want to be one of them without having to hide anything. i wish i could just look people in the face without having to feel like i want to die while they look at mine. i want to show people me, the true me I have been hiding all my life........but i do not even like her, why do i expect them to like her......what is there to even like?? nothing. that is right nothing. no wonder why i have not let her out in years. no one would want to see her pathetic, ugly self. but she is still me though..she is the only one who is been with me through everything, she is the only person who truly knows me, she is seen my true colors, my unfiltered self, she knows every part of me and she continues to be here. she is seen me at my lowest and while she did not say anything good to comfort me, i felt her presence...at least i was not completely alone after all. i hate her so much but without her i would not have survived.....but is that even a good thing?? it would have been better if i did not anyways. i have nothing to live for. all this time, I have been chasing something that was not there. getting lost in a mirage of lies but i contiued to run regardless. running after something that is not written in my destiny. how pathetic. younger me was really pathetic wishing for happiness each day like her wishes were not just getting ignored and pushed to the side each time. she had hope. hope for something that will never happen.* idek"}

{"post": "I just called a crysis hotline what a waste of time and tearsI don t want to make a new reddit account because I tried to last time I wanted to post and ended locked out of the site and it was just a nightmare so ya don t wreck my life and find out who i am I just called a crysis hotline and it was busy lol and I called more times and it was busy twice and then it rang and I hung up and then I called twice more and it was busy both times then I found another line for some local crysis centre i used to work as a telephone surveyer it was like someone trying to sell me a long distance plan over the phone just keep me on the line and keep trying to make the crysis center upsell special one time offer how about we send a mobile crysis unit and they come talk to you actually that sounds terrible I just wanted to talk to somebody about my problems because my doctor can t see me till feburary and I have no friends and my parents are a large part of the problem so basically I am alone I am completely and utterly alone and nobody really cares it s all up to you she says wow what a thing to say to someone with depression yes I know all my lifes decisions have been made by me i know that my life is either shitty or it isn t based off my actions I very much know that why would I be depressed if I didn t blame myself just fucking terrible now I m just drainned and sorta just pissed off instead of suicidal it s like the only support they will offer is putting you in a halfway house well I work fulltime so that s not gonna work and I don t have vacation days and I work nights so one of the things they do there is get you on a routine and give you support classes and whatever well that s not really gonna work if I get up at pm and go to bed at noon pm so basically the only support society has to offer is completely fucking up my life I actually don t mind my job I actually like it there it s the one safe spot in the world is work I live at home and I live my parents who raised very very fat I was obese by kindergarden and I have been since but I know it s not there fault because we are all only to blame ourselves for our problems then I tried to start losing the weight and I almost lost it all and then it s just they leave open bags of chips and cookies and chocolauts and just the most unhealthy high calorie garbage all over the house but why don t I just move out well because I tried to start a business with my credit and it didn t work out and now my current job barely pays off my loan payments and I ve maxed out my credit cards paying them rent which they feel they rightously deserve and are the greatest parents they know in their lives for not just telling me to get the fuck out I didn t even ask them to change their habits I just asked for them not to leave junk out where I can see it this was responded to in a way I only decribe by saying have you ever tried to take food away from an aggressive dog and they growl at you just completely almost out of charecter just an instintive aggressive violent response with no reason or consideration so now I m stuck and I really wanna kill myself just because I know they will get stuck with my debt I m not even hopelessly in debt I just can t leave here but I can t live being this fat anymore because nobody will love me or even even affectionitly touch me I don t even mean sex I just me anything not out of sympathy or pity from a female you know I don t even blame them for regecting me anymore they all actually out of their way nice to me so ya whatever I guess I m taking some art classes and I found out I m very talented lol I m a very honest person in a way that s great on camera But I m fat and people don t have sympathy for fat people well unless there in the process of asking forgiveness and making claims of future weight loss if you just try to put them in a normal life situation people inheritly react negatively because fat people are ugly I think it too but ya I can t fix it I know people won t accept this statement but when I m on my healthy diet I feel great and am not hungry because it s well balanced and not extremely low calorie But I come home from work and it s just there is food and sugar everywhere and as soon I get eating it I want more and then i don t care because I think I ve already fucked it up for myself I might as well just eat more so I don t feel bad and then i feel great for a little while and then I crash off the sugar and I feel terrible I feel god awful I feel doing nothing in the world that won t seem like unenjoyable effort and I just think about how bad I feel and how much I don t want to feel that way anymore and how much I wish i could just do something that would make me feel better so I get in my car and I drive to one of the oh so many mcdonalds and I get double cheeseburgers and each has calories that s calories I can eat in I dunno stop lights away from the mcdonalds and that like more than half of my total daily calorie needs on top of the regular diet which is about under my daily needs and the fucking near thousand calories of just junk food my parents leave around then all of a sudden I m like calories over my needs and then that s evey day and that s like all in the last hours of the day and the next day maybe I just don t care anymore and instead of coffee or diet coke in the morning for caffiene maybe I go and get two calorie energy drinks and the high is so good and the crash is so hard and I eat a couple more thousand calories of junk when I get home and feel terrible from crash it s just I meet people and I fall in love with them and I can see they care about me they go out of there way to be nice to me because they see how down I get on myself but if I ever try to just anything just any interaction beyond this totally not out of your way interaction I know we re in a art class and you say things to me that let me know you don t hate me because I act like I think you hate me but it s not because you hate me it s because I love yes I know I don t know what the word means but I like to use it you and you ll regect me and it s easier for me to perceive it as hate and you go out of your way to say it isn t and you care that little bit and I think why did she say that and you think maybe she likes me and it s just this natural reaction and attraction no desperation there isn t time to get desperate and you just say I m gonna play it cool and later maybe do something and then you get home and you remember I m almost pounds and she was just being nice and if I you even tried to talk to her directly outside of what the art deems nessisary she ll regect you like everyone else because you ve done that that same thing has happend dozens of times and you ve played it out like groundhogs day where you ve done every possible thing reacted everyway tried everything including not trying and it has all ended the same you know the worst part lately is I started going to the gym years ago and I m actually in pretty good shape I m just really really fat I lifting and flexibility and I cycle even though it s really hard being so fat and I got down to I m which the lightest I ve been in ever even as a kid I always had a higher body fat percentage the first time I ve been under bmi since I ve remember checking my weight and now in months I ve thrown away all of it and gained lbs and I remember how hard it was to lose and I remember I had all the advantages of starting something new and being excited about my new diet and just being able to ignore the junk food mostly it was always an issue always adding a few hundred calories here and there and now it s like you can sell everything you own get your debt to a controlable level and move out but I have to move walking distance from work because i bought a car when I was younger and I broke down and I lost my entire investment and my oh so generous and horribly unappreciated parents let me drive one there vechiles to work after they moved and took me with them it was a mistake to move out with them but I would have no car and I couldn t take my art classes or even have access to a gym because there isn t one around my work where I would have to move to and only be able to walk because there is no public transportation around there so ya I was looking for place in the river to jump in thin ice around some shores and I m not tryhing to violate the rules it s just it seemed like a good idea I was just gonna jump and swim to shore if I could make it and that seemed like a good idea then just go to the emergency room and cry and they would have to something I dunno it seemed lik e the only way to get any attention to my suffering without having to get in a confrontation with someone but whatever I m really tired now and I just want someone I dunno there is nothing I know nobody can help me the things I want that will make me happy I can t ask and don t have any right to ask but crying makes me tried and I don t like having to hear myself crying wouldn t be so bad if I didn t have to hear the whale it s like someone else it s like I m hearing some other person in the most heart breaking hopeless disappar and it frightens me I m just thinking wrong reacting wrong I just don t interpet the world correctly and everything that makes me meserable is all in my head and is all just a chosen personality flaw that I need to get over or go to therapy for and all of this will start over again tomorrow but it ll be friday so I can play video games on the weekend and maybe I ll get some mcdonalds and a big sugar slurpee and I ll be happy that s what I have to look forward to the only thing good in my life is the thing that makes so terrible"}

They're a senior in high school and our relationship has worked with very few problems over the years. However, something that has always happened in our relationship is they'll bounce back and forth between wanting to date or not wanting to date, getting upset with me randomly and so on. One month they want to run away with me and I'm the best thing ever, and the next I'm a hindrance and not worthy. It makes a lot of sense now that we finally understand what's going on. I'm bipolar myself, so I don't struggle with understanding this issue at all, but what are things that I can do to help my girlfriend and navigate the times when they feel unsure? \n \n I always feel like there isn't much I can really do but just take my hands off the situation and let them figure out how they feel.

{"post": "Lately, I’ve been very depressed, and my BPD has been the worst it has in a while. I feel like 99% of the time I’m dissociating, or smoking weed, which doesn’t even help me anymore because I’ve developed such a high tolerance. I feel like I’ve been a jerk to my girlfriend, who is also my FP. I’ve been a jerk to my friends too. I barely speak anymore. I barely do anything. I just dissociate all day and stare blankly. But I also fly off the handle easily. The smallest thing will make me irrationally upset or angry, and it’s really hard for me to control it. I know I’ve been horrible and toxic, and the shame I feel for all my actions seems to weigh me even deeper. The more toxic I get, the more ashamed and filled with self hatred I become, and the more I hate myself, the more angry and emotionally erratic I get. I don’t know what to do. I’m on anti depressants, and I feel like they worked really well for me at first, but now they don’t work very well at all and I’m right where I was before I was hospitalized a few months ago. I feel so lost and helpless and I need help"}

{"post": "Two days ago I posted something so cute about hitting 76 days clean and now I’m all fucked up. Idk what happened but my bf (LDR) said that he wanted to shorten my trip length from a week to just a weekend. This changed comes after about a week of him acting really weird, he says he’s got a concussion but he worked and drank too much making it worse. I was ok with that but I wish he told me before when he was acting weird so I knew. \n \n He wasn’t talking to me or texting me as much as he used to saying he needs to minimize phone time or he just doesn’t use his phone when he’s out or with fam or friends but he’s with them 24/7!! The phone is literally how we communicate and how this relationship works!! I felt abandoned like he just didn’t care bc he refused to compromise, we went from talking ~1-2 hr on the phone each day and like 500???? texts to like ~30 min on the phone and 100 texts a day. \n \n I really hurt. I felt alone. He has so much time with his friends and family in person and I don’t ever get to see him, and he still wants to shorten our trip that is literally still a week and a half away bc of his concussion when he literally does the same stuff we’d be doing maybe even more when I came up. He says he needs to feel independent but I’m literally 1000 miles away and am just ducking asking for 8% of ur time every day. \n \n He knew I had BPD from the start but I have genuinely been able to control it better than ever before until tonight. I just feel like he’s making excuses to not talk to me and not let me come up anymore, but why? You know what my mind jumps to… I believe him when he says he had a concussion but I really just feel like he changed into a different person. He went from being the perfect person everyone loved him promising me everything caring and understanding and now he acts like I’m fucking disgusting and he hates me. \n \n Tonight he promised me that I would have a chance to call and talk to him for a while, but then he called late and said he was tired and needed to go to sleep to rest up instead but then I texted him a little later and he texted back and he had just been chilling with his brother who he sees CONSTANTLY. And then called his friend instead of talking to me after promising me!! He always sees and talks to these people he lives so close to them! He literally just acts like he fucking hates me and I’ve kept it together for a fucking week and a half and I really just wanted to fuckinf see him for enough time. \n \n I called him over and over and he blocked me and made his cousin block me and I just SH. Fuck it. Im so sick and tired of everything. Ok goodnight."}

{"post": "Getting Worse Deteriorating Self WorthWas at the coffee shop several days ago that I go to so I can get out of the house and talked with a girl working at the counter She had heard from one of the other workers that I liked to draw and asked if I could draw I smiled and said yes She asked me if I could paint and I said that I could Nothing fancy of course I told her about how I ve been wanting to go to a place nearby where they have paint supplies to use there but I didn t want to go alone This girl responded with I d love to go I was in shock when I heard this as I m in my early s and have been rejected by girls since I first tried at I ve always been socially awkward and have just gotten more that way over the years from bullying and harassment I told her I was surprised by her response and how the previous girl I asked to go out there thought I was asking for sex and humiliated me in front of everyone in the store She gave a sad aww why and I told her I had no idea She asked when I wanted to go and I told her that my schedule is usually free so whatever time is convenient for her She said she would be happy to go at the first convenient time for her I was actually feeling somewhat happy just knowing I d be able to go out with someone and do something fun I told her she could have my number and just call me whenever she thought was a good time and proceeded to give her my number My anxiety since then has been really high consistently Fast forward a few days and I hadn t received any call or text so when I finally met her at the coffee shop again I asked her if she still wanted to go paint She told me she wrote my number down and misplaced it only to find it in her work attire She sent me a text to confirm the number and I added her to my contacts That girl motivated me to do more art in the coffee shop but my depression and anxiety constantly surround me days would go by until I gave in and tried to lightly bring up the subject of whether she had any idea when would be convenient for her Her response was I ve been really busy I broke down several days later and sent her a text saying that I was feeling really miserable and needed someone to talk to I thought for sure she was going to get irritated with me and finally just stop talking to me Her response was one of the kindest I ve ever had from anyone more so from a girl She offered to sit with me and talk after they closed the shop and she was definitely wanting to go paint with me I sent a few more texts about how miserable I ve felt just being stuck in my head and how I couldn t believe the kindness she was showing me compared to anyone in this life She shared her own experiences and I could actually relate to her At this point I started to fall more in love I guess At the end of the night we sat outside and talked I almost started crying while talking to her because the more she shared the more I could relate until another worker who I think was making fun of me for the previous incident with the other girl pulled up to us on his motorcycle and asked if we wanted to go to the nearby diner and maybe eat something I had to use the restroom so I gave in and said yes jokingly saying that if they have a restroom then sure I try as hard as I can to minimize showing any kind of problems going on with me just to avoid the anger I have from setting off stupid aggressive people We get up and meet at the diner where it s now of us including another worker and suddenly the one on one talk with the girl turned into a fucking group therapy session where the other two blatantly stated they ve never experienced the hardships I ve had to go through and shared their own stories I could see everyone was beginning to get progressively more depressed as I shared I couldn t bring myself to share everything I wanted to with the girl just to connect with her I wanted to so much but there I was locked in my fucking head fighting anger and sadness from overwhelming everyone It was about in the morning when we finally got up the guy on the motorcycle said he would be at the coffee shop to hear the rest of my story We had a small talk outside of the diner and since it was cold the girl was shivering and that one other guy not in a relationship with her opened his arms and held the girl to keep her warm I looked away and stared at the guy on the motorcycle while he talked but I couldn t get that out of my head even as it continued for a minute When I got back to the car I put my head down wanting to just disappear My anger and sadness was overwhelming partly from being unable to have a one on one connection with that girl and her hugging the guy was burned into my mind which brought more shit from my past flooding forward When I got home I sent her a message saying I shouldn t have agreed to that group sitting that it was extremely painful for me The next day when I went to draw at the coffee shop that guy with the motorcycle never showed up I could barely look the girl in the face and I sent more texts about how miserable I felt but there was no response until closer to the end of the day My depression from opening up was getting extremely bad Once again the responses she had were some of the kindest responses I ve ever received When I got home I had more conversation with her and I broke down because of her kind responses and her struggles in life were relatable Her kindness had brought my depression down and done more than any doctors or medications were ever able to I told her you helped me so I m going to help you I offered to help her pay the rent as a thank you for being so damn kind and bring me back from a bad place She refused and told me she was trying not to cry after hearing that and seeing the money At this point was extremely embarrassed standing there around other patrons and some of the other works I didn t think she understood how much she just helped me perhaps saved me so I insisted and she refused again So partly in anger I left the money on the counter of the coffee shop telling her that someone was going to take it if she didn t I was fully intending to do that because her helped meant the world to me and I refused to take it back but she came up to me with the money and told me she hadn t earned it and refused to accept it My response was how she had done more than any doctors or meds had ever done before I finally gave in and took the money back I got to my car and sent her a message that it wasn t fair how I felt useless when she refused my help I felt even more miserable on my way home I think I probably freaked her out after that incident I sent more texts trying to talk to her wanting to just be with someone somewhere NOT STUCK IN MY FUCKING HEAD Either that night or the next I left the house She had stopped responding to my texts Sent multiple texts describing how I had no idea where my life was going I told her I wanted to leave and sit somewhere to watch the sun rise I didn t want to be alone I was fucking tired of constantly being stuck in my head I wanted to tell her that I wanted to be with her more than anything All I could muster was just statements of loneliness What transpired after was me driving in the night until the sun started coming up I took some pictures of the sunrise and sent them to her with the message Even though you didn t accept the money please accept this sunrise as my thank you I was so exhausted for the rest of my trip back home from being awake all night I sent one last message saying I was going to fall asleep and hoped that her day turned out to be great There hadn t been any responses for the past day something she never let drag on and I figured at this point she either got tired of reading my shit or was simply busy as she repeatedly implied when I asked about going to paint Regardless I felt an overwhelming love for this girl and as I fell asleep I actually was able to drift off without too much trouble When I woke up several hours later today there was still no response since the night before I decided to not brood over negative possibilities and just go draw something at the coffee shop and try to relax as best I could with this depression constantly there I got to the coffee shop and the girl was there she asked me if I d gotten some rest which implied that she had read everything I sent Further more she said nothing about the sun rise photos that I sent her All she mentioned was me getting some rest I put so much effort into getting the photos of that sunrise there was a drunk in front of me at one point swerving into oncoming traffic Depression kicked in heavily and I ordered something before sitting down and drawing trying to tune out everything around me The two guys that joined us at the diner were working there today as well Through out the day I could hear the of them laughing and picked out several comments making fun of me I removed the girl from my contacts so she wouldn t have to see any more depressing things from me and I m sure there s not going to be any painting with someone else I felt myself shrinking further and further inwards Smaller smaller smaller nothing just not wanting to be here anymore I wrote in my sketchpad You asked me if I got rest that told me you read the messages I had to piece two and two together that I was talking to myself I removed you from my contacts so you don t have to read my stuff any more I thought the sunrise photos were nice If you care please speak to me in person Show me through your actions I let you in Invite me out ask me to hang out show me you care I want to cry right now but I feel a painful emptiness inside no tears just sadness Tired and sick"}
{"post": "Lied my way out of the psych ward So a week ago I made a post asking if I should tell guidance about my failed suicide attempt Someone said I should and I decided to do it I ended up going to a psych ward as I thought I would and I just got out yesterday I was telling them that I felt better when in reality I still feel like killing myself I just didn t want to be in there anymore because the doctor didn t give a shit I told him that I wasn t feeling good when he asked how I was doing and he said If I went to the grocery store and asked how the clerk was doing I expect them to say good because that s the polite thing to do I don t want to hear their whole life story all I want to do is pay for my thing which made no fucking sense because it s not a grocery store it s a fucking psych ward I m supposed to be honest with how I am feeling After that he quickly wrapped the conversation up and the next day he would talk about his life He clearly didn t give a fuck I want to tell my therapist that I am thinking of trying suicide again but I am scared to go back and I don t know what to do Any help would be greatly appreciated"}

{"post": "I can't revise"}
{"post": "I feel like I ve lost my mindMan life sucks This will be a long summary of what led me to my caption above I F am so tired of living Every single day that I wake up feels like a struggle so I just stopped waking up I sleep all day I sleep until it s the middle of the night and then I wake up because I can t sleep anymore I hate my life In summary I was born as a refugee and brought here as a severely malnourished child with many health related issues that I overcame Due to the fact of assimilating to America as a small baby with a mom who barely could speak English and older siblings with severe PTSD we had an extremely rough upbringing We were starving and hungry most of our days We landed in New York and were brought to Boston The income disparity between me and my peers were staggering My older siblings got jobs to support us and my mom fell into a deep depression that debilitated her and in turn made her completely bed ridden I wouldn t consider my mom abusive but after going to therapy I found that I was severely neglected as a child My mom had really bad PTSD and horrific depression Most days she stayed in bed as I watched her body deteriorate She was prone to many illnesses due to her major depressive state My mom had also been brutally sexually assaulted and raped trying to emigrate all of us Due to this fact she always assumed that I couldn t be around anyone of the opposite sex including my own brothers uncles cousins and most especially others My mom would do daily checkups and check my genitalia anytime I would leave the house and come back home just to see if my hymen was intact still I was such an anxious kid because of this I would always jump when she would come around Yet on the flip side I was attached to my mom at the hip in a very unhealthy way My dad came to America for two short years and could ve done so much for us He was an engineer Yet he was a scumbag and decided to leave my mom because of his toxic habits and laziness He went back to the homeland so he could have maids and cooks and marry a young year old woman who would bear more kids for him Anyway I was the youngest out of I was advanced in school I did EVERYTHING I needed to do to escape poverty and to escape the environment I was being raised in I told myself that this life wouldn t last long I told myself that one day I would be able to take care of all of us included the rest of my extended family who couldn t escape the war torn country we emigrated from My mom moved us to a different state when I was about years old so we could be closer to people who were from our ethnicity since Boston had very little refugees from my country This was the biggest mistake We went from a city that had ample opportunities to a place with little to none We were subjected to even worse poverty and hunger and terrible living conditions Boston was more of an advanced city they had programs for people like us and educational opportunities that kept my mind working and my stomach full I spent most of my days daydreaming I would write a lot and read anything I could get my hands on shampoo bottles textbooks anything to keep me from my mind Most of my younger years were spent in my bedroom I wasn t allowed to hang out with friends go to the movies you can say I was extremely sheltered I wasn t allowed to leave the home unless it was for school or a doctor Me and the rest of my siblings always assumed it was because my mom was protecting us but as an adult I found out that it was because she had agoraphobia and severe anxiety She wanted us around because she would have panic attacks if she was ever left alone Up until this day shes never spent one day by herself At the age of I skipped my th grade year and tested out straight to high school I was in my freshman year of high school albeit being socially stunted compared to my classmates I was cognitively equal I spent three years in high school and skipped my th grade year I was when I graduated high school I got accepted to a plethora of colleges including Harvard It was my dream come true I was finally going to be back in the same city I used to live in Cambridge Ma My mom wouldn t allow it She said no to everything because I was too young She instead had me enrolled into a local community college My dreams were shattered Everything I had ever worked for was gone At I received my associates and finished my degree at the community college It was at this point when my mom had to leave the country to visit family This was the first time in my life I spent a single day without her During the time she was away I decided to be a teenager for the first time in my life I hung out with my friends attended parties and smoked my first joint By this point most of my older siblings moved out and began lives of their own There were only two of us left in the home me y o and my sister who was y o It was one of my older sisters who took the task to watch over us while my mom was away I met the love of my life while my mom was gone He was much older than me but we aligned in every single way He was I was I ve spent everyday with him minus a few up until now I felt like life was finally going to be great A year later I got accepted to the local university to finish my bachelors and found out I was expecting a child I had several good years and went on to finish my bachelors and land a job at the worlds leading tech companies The depression finally went away This is when we were given the horrible news We found out that my husband was diagnosed with a rare autoimmune disease and was in end stage kidney failure He required dialysis x a week to survive He lost his ability to walk My heart was broken The depression returned My life turned upside down again years of panic and anxiety and finally he received a kidney transplant It s been months since he received a new kidney and he has a few more surgeries left to help him walk again but I can t feel anything anymore I m numb I should be happy but I feel nothing at all I turned to alcohol because everything became too much I became an alcoholic I drink every day I drink my days away I think about how there s darkness looming around every corner I don t take my medication because I ve been down that road and I feel like it won t stop life from causing me to suffer I ve done therapy group therapy inpatient and outpatient treatments I feel like this shit is never going to end I just want to make it end Life is miserable and I really feel like I lost my mind TLDR I had a shitty upbringing and as soon as I thought I escaped my adulthood was even worse I ve lost hope"}

{"post": "When I feel the emptiness, it’s like I’ve fallen into a hell void where I feel nothing at all except a deep anguish and desperate need for life to be over ASAP. All I can think about is suicide and I suffer so much over the fact that I don’t think I could ever actually bring myself to do it. Every minute of the day that passes is unbearable. I feel utter despair. It feels like it will last forever and I can’t remember a time it wasn’t happening. I feel desperate and hopeless and helpless in the face of the pain. I can’t do a thing except smoke cigarettes and tell people over and over again that “I need to die. I can’t take this. It’s unbearable.” Does anyone else experience this? Does ANYTHING help you? I have no effective coping skills for this. It’s completely incapacitating. It comes and goes without warning, as it pleases. It is so fucking painful."}

{"post": "Here s my rant about being miserable and depressed It helps to write it out even if it makes me cry more Basically everyone but my boyfriend and parents think I m pretty much fine including my professors school friends My boyfriend knows I m extremely depressed and suicidal and my parents know I m as bad as I was when I was which implies the same My therapist probably knows I m suicidal but I promised myself years ago when it was this bad before I d never go to a mental hospital again voluntarily because it s extremely traumatic for me I stopped seeing her because I don t want her to involuntarily commit me Specifically going between now and early January is an over my dead body type option because I ve been procrastinating grad school applications and need to finish them all by early January Going to the mental hospital literally rips away my support system and coping mechanisms completely such as talking to my boyfriend going on Reddit playing video games listening to people on discord sleeping as much as I want eating food I like etc The hospital also makes it so I might not be able to graduate from college on time or get bad grades which would mean I d have to reapply to graduate programs which would be enough to make me actually do it I m a good student and have a and a in my major which is great I have a really competitive internship in my field of study lined up for the spring in addition to my prior related work experience I love my field and feel like I m actually helping people My professors love me and almost all of them are willing to give me a letter of recommendation for grad school which is great The problem is no one would fucking believe that I m constantly suicidal and taking a semester off isn t an option I have a disability hearing or whatever it s called in March I m scared it s going to come out that I m very suicidal and I ll be sent off to the hospital again Like I m in a catch be re traumatized and potentially have to go to the hospital again and not graduate on time or have them not understand the gravity of the situation The guy who s the judge clearly doesn t get mental health stuff in my opinion based on previous times I ve talked with him It s like either go full NEET be hospitalized not regulate myself and they take me seriously or try to make a future for myself and be less suicidal and they don t take me seriously at all Being able to hold down easy credits of coursework that requires maybe hours of work a day and hrs a week internship isn t the same as being able to hold down a hour a week job My boyfriend is fucking incredible and the most supportive person aside from my parents I ve ever met I can t imagine life without him The problem is I feel so utterly inadequate because he has a physical disability that makes it so I have to do a lot of the chores like taking out the trash doing dishes etc yet I have fucking meltdowns that I can t control like crying fits if I m asked to do almost anything most of the time I get so short with him and lose it over tint stuff because I m so constantly miserable It s not intentional at all and I love him so much and do my best to be supportive of him I m so afraid of losing him yet I can t fucking control myself He can work and stuff thankfully at least and works in a well paying industry that he is really talented at I ve probably gained lbs in years easily from depression eating I went from pretty toned hourglass shape lifting weights x a week and walking tons around lbs at and about a size to now maybe a size x and lbs I m covered in unappealing stretch marks I haven t brushed my hair in a month or two so it s extremely tangled and knotted I struggle to brush my teeth I wear dirty clothes for weeks at a time I shower maybe once every three weeks I wish I was kidding I have very little interest in sex or anything like that but I try to at least once a week initiate something with my boyfriend because I don t want him to leave me He basically says it s not necessary to do this but I just don t want him to leave me I have a lot of weed because I m in a legal state temporarily and it s one of the only things that helps I don t take other medication because since covid I literally can t remember to especially not twice a day Also the old medication made me have shitty side effects like being difficult to orgasm sleep hrs a day made me extremely nauseous and didn t really help that much with my mood I ve tried basically every medication in the book I have a really weird case and rarely get concrete diagnoses I think I have bipolar and borderline personality disorder if I had to guess after being a former psych major for a while plus the diagnosis I ve heard from former psychiatrists But I ve also been encouraged to be tested for autism by a psychiatrist which I also think could explain a ton That s basically how I ve been doing It kinda helped a little to write out my feelings so thank you for having this subreddit I understand if no one responds but thank you if you do"}

university entrence exams I ve graduated with gpa score I ve gone to Sweden with Erasmus programme I ve played in a great band for the first years of my university life had been selpt with women which I had a serious relationship that last years with of them I ve graduated and got accepted for the graduate school that I wanted and currently I am studying Game Technologies My first ever game had got downloaded by million people during my first job experience This year at th Februrary everything was changed My girlfriend dumbed me for a fuckboy my parents got divorced and they were very verbal to me about this topic I had to swtich jobs because I thought I was underpayed and being used there and now I am working in defense industries totally different industry that I d imagine for my career I dont know I think I ve accomplished much during my school years but whenever I look back I say to myself I could do better I could do better if I was living in a different country I could do better if I didn t waste my time on two long serious relationships I could do better if I decided to study abroad and just accept my parent s offer to pay for it I didn t want to make them pay for MY education I could do better if I didn t have a girlfriend when I was living in sweden with eramus programme I could do better if I didn t stop making music or writing poems and stories I could do better if I didn t take the job at defense industries so early that quitting the job means getting banned from the best paying sector in Turkey Everything I did seems like a failure to me And worst of all I ve gained a lot of weight my self esteem is on the ground I just stopped believing myself or in other words I stopped lying myself about I can accomplish anything Anyways for people around me I am a succesfull mature intellectual functioning person with interesting hobbies But inside of my mind these things just doesn t matter I was so pumped by my parents my friends and my girlfriends nothing I do satisfies me and I am feeling like I am slowly losing all my skills social artistic general etc I dont add value to anyone around me Noone needs me Noone craves for my love needs my support needs me around them I was such a nice guy to all my friends and lovers But in the end I was the one who got screwed up by them I can not seem to get laid nowadays if you exclude some of my ex gf s that really affects me because I was used to have a regular sex life and boy it was great I cannot meet with new people and make them like me like used to I could sit on a table that I know only one person at that table and carry the conversation for hours but now I am just struggling with even answering the basic questions I used to have strong believes about life politics relationships I m an atheist and know I realize that these believes just made me loser in the end and I cannot change them because they are infused into my mind Turkey is a very depressing place if you have at least slightly above the average intellectual capacities and I feel like I am trapped in this place where people are sooo terrible muslim heads who long for the glorious days of ignorance and bigotry of ottoman empire wannabe highly cultural social media slaves plaza workers bigheaded academics who doesn t give a shit about their thesis student women who satisfies themselves with shallow relationships or expects irrationally much from men people who cannot appreciate a good company and keep expecting a personal benefit from every relationship they have Fuck I am so overwhelmed trying to describe the state of mind I am in I am so sorry people I wish English was my mother tongue but it isn t and I am not confident the way I express myself This life is too complicating too demanding too shallow and most importantly too worthless especially in Turkey I want to leave here but I don t know if I can find the happiness and peace in another country Here I am an intellectual succesfull computer engineer outside of Turkey I am a fucking roach I ve sent my cv to a lot of places outside the country Noone wants me How do I escape here Should I escape here and leave all of my successes and failures behind me and start a new life Would it worth the effort I don t know Death seems like such a sweet release to me I just want to die naturally at this moment in an instant I had enough I had my peak at this life and I am just slowly going down to a horrible end I can feel it I ve been depressed before even got some medical treatment for it It doesn t feel like being depressed at all It is just there is no meaning in anything at all We are bunch of atoms Dying will just stop all of it I wouldn t care for anyone and anything If I was dead I wouldn t be upset about the fact that I could do much have children and stuff Dead doesn t care Dead is dead and for the last month I just feel like there is no point delaying the inevitable"}
