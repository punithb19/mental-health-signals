My Story I Don t Want to Be Here AnymoreHello my name is Calvin I m a year old kid and I think I m done for good this time As far as my backstory I don t know where to start I grew up well had good parents and being an only child I ended up being spoiled as fuck looking back I wish I wasn t as it played into some bad mindsets later down the road but never mind that as I grew up life never had many issues until the early teen years and onwards Since then was an absolute downwards spiral there started my porn addiction loss of friends lack of connection with everyone in my life lack of desire for anything on the flipside when age hit the drive struck to turn all of it around since that point I started working on quitting my bad habits and made progress I have reconnected with friends I have started working on music that makes me feel fulfilled more than ever Looking back on this year the most things have happened this year than any point in my life despite the pandemic What went wrong Ever since three days ago something happened it was like the energy got zapped out of me Not just mentally but physically aswell Usually when I hit a low point there s always some sort of big spark that arises that inspires me to get back up again That spark hasn t arrived I ve tried everything in my power to build the momentum again Better sleep eating healthier working out everything that used to revive me in the past nothing Nothing is working I genuinely feel like my soul does not have the power to get back up again this time for good At this point I m looking for a quick way to end it I ve lost all interest in my hobbies relationships and myself I am ready to be done with this,"Cause of Distress, Positive Coping",medium

What am I missing I was about to write I hope I am missing something as the title but that would be wrong I am not hoping per se more like I m checking one more time if I left the stove on before I leave There s nothing for me in here I hold very little value for money belongings social status And people are worthless to me because they value the aforementioned are making themselves about those and from those I am afraid that if I explain myself or my views fully I ll infect someone else with this but be warned I ll elaborate and will tell my views if asked they might seem not that bad at first or for a few years but it s a seed that grows slowly So don t be arrogant about it it s nothing special it s not a big secret and that s the twist Anyway There s just no point going on there s nothing here for me that I can see To me life seems to be just a waiting place for death to keep yourself busy so death can surprise you But how to keep yourself busy I nothing holds meaning to me I can t get attached to things that disappear eventually I am too emotional for that My memories of the most beautiful wonderful and magnificent people I have met are torturing me as it is And I don t want any more pain The most meaningful things hurt the most and that s why I don t want them because the pain is always the last thing of that deal That s what I am left with And if I continue regardless it will eventually lead me to the same conclusion the pain kills me Life is so beautiful that it kills me So why die in pain when it is possible to die without it If I don t take life to my heart then there s no point continuing either because I m holding back nothing is that important to me it s meaningless So here s why I am writing this is something I am missing before I make the biggest decision I can ever make An unchecked stove somewhere If so where should I look for it when I am somewhat aware of this gt A Sioux creation story says that long ago the Creator gathered all of Creation and said I want to hide something from the humans until they are ready for it It is the realization that they create their own reality gt The eagle said Give it to me I will take it to the moon gt The Creator said No One day they will go there and find it gt The salmon said I will bury it on the bottom of the ocean gt No They will go there too gt The buffalo said I will bury it on the Great Plains gt The Creator said They will cut into the skin of the Earth and find it even there gt Grandmother Mole who lives in the breast of Mother Earth and who has no physical eyes but sees with spiritual eyes said Put it inside of them gt And the Creator said It is done Also this might be a long conversation or the shortest ever with no reply So if you are not up to the challenge help someone else your words may be wasted on me Speak from the heart and if nothing comes up then continue on it s not your fight Truth should be effortless But don t be intimidated your words can make a difference who knows it can be as little as Dude you forgot to drink your coffee and then it all dawns on me lol no promises though don t beat yourself up but anyway I wanna go so did leave something undone Something worth checking out Inb ur lyfe AC movie Rogue one movie and the year Thanks in advance,"Cause of Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Mental Distress",medium

In Canada what are the consequences of making a suicide attempt and recovering LONG text sorry This subreddit is very quiet but I don t think my question would be allowed in r AskReddit r AskCanadian subreddit is very quiet too I hope someone knowledgeable can help me Please correct me if I m wrong When you attempt suicide in Canada and police or paramedics are called this event is recorded in the Canadian Police Information Centre CPIC database as well as any relevant local police and medical databases From googling I ve found out that consequences include I won t been able to get a firearms license a wise restriction I probably won t be able to travel to https www thestar com news gta canadian woman denied entry to us because of suicide attempt html or through the USA suicide attempts can be recorded in the Canadian Police Information Centre database which is somewhat https en wikipedia org wiki Canadian Police Information Centre accessible http www cbc ca news canada windsor canadians mental health info routinely shared with fbi u s customs by the FBI and U S Customs and Border Protection If a person attempts suicide recovers and is able to become mentally healthy and live a normal life what other permanent negative consequences are there Can insurance companies dig up this information Affecting extended private health life or even auto insurance eligibility Will prospective employers be able to find this through background checks Will mental health history be covered in the Canadian Government Security Screening I mean will you be treated like a convicted criminal not allowed to work with confidential information like someone who helps do your taxes or a medical office assistant transport medical supplies like insulin or donated blood or transport hazardous materials like a freight truck driver transporting a load of pool cleaning supplies Security screening focuses on your reliability https en wikipedia org wiki Security clearance Canada I can t find specific mention of mental health but I think that can be considered a significant factor of a person s reliability I also don t know the negative long term consequences of having suicidal thoughts or involuntary hospitalization in my medical record Will this also hurt my ability to get a job or insurance I m afraid to admit to anyone that I ve seriously considered killing myself I don t want to be involuntarily locked up for three months https www legalline ca legal answers involuntary hospital admission of mentally ill people and length of stay or more Years ago I had a psychotherapist who just kept prescribing different drugs which left me feeling extremely detached unable to concentrate on anything and a lot of other side effects like dry mouth I don t want that again I hated those drugs I had a very difficult time finding a psychotherapist who seemed right for me I hesitate to say this but I found some of them very unprofessional one spent all of our sessions asking me technical computer questions and essentially getting paid to pester me as his personal IT support person he was the drug pusher another was working hard on an academic thesis with a really narrow focus which he forcefully tried to apply to all of our therapy sessions whether it made sense or not He would ignore any patient problems or issues if they were not dream related and can also be drawn on paper He adamantly refused to do anything else I couldn t make this up if I tried All of this turned me off of therapy for years Canadian healthcare might be better than in the United States in some ways but there s a lot of flaws and problems too In recent days I had been having increasingly frequent suicidal thoughts but so far it s gone down and I ve been holding steady I managed to find a relative to talk to Not a resolution or even a reliable source of support but it s pulled me back from the edge Also finding this https www camh ca en hospital health information a z mental health and addiction information suicide Pages default aspx web page at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health Canada helped It s slender comfort but where the page explains why and Who is at risk and What a re the warning signs it was like a brief warm sunbeam because whoever wrote that web page understood exactly how I feel Thank you for taking the time to read all this I hope someone can answer my questions How screwed am I if there are records of me having attempted suicide or being locked up in a hospital or even admitting that I wanted to die,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update, Seeking Help",high

Thoughts I m a male I m and I ve done drugs in the past hours Now I sit back down at my computer at my parents house and start on my second beer I was a hopeful lad great at baseball and a seeming knack for just getting it I counted the girls that liked me on my fingers while taking a poop That was like rd grade I had orthodontics for years and even though I didn t decide for myself that I wanted to do the treatment or perform the treatment I feel the blame for the negative results and think the whole thing genuinely fucked up my life I feel the blame for the process because to some degree or another I do feel that we are responsible for our cards Call it Karma I still want to blame others I should have had better follow up and guidance during the orthodontic process After all I started when I was What went wrong was that I was a boy I didn t like to take showers and I didn t like to wear fucking headgear or retainers at night so I didn t and being young what could go wrong Mistake My transition to my freshman year of college was greeted by a lovely surprise Because of my orthodontics and sparse retainer use the way my teeth came together shifted and started wreaking havoc with how I hold my jaw My jaw started jutting forward producing an underbite which was new to me Picture this Here I am freshman year of college supposedly the most socially engaging and fun years of my life and I have a lower jaw that s growing like Pinocchio I totally freaked and even though I made attempts at being social it never came naturally and increasing jaw tension and attention on the jaw only made matters worse At this point I started becoming increasingly reclusive All social situations were an uphill battle and subconsciously I couldn t wait to get out of them I know as a culture we re socially stunted my big thing is that I m special because I really had it bad with this I started to recognize that every conversation I started to have turned into me introspectively judging how my jaw looks to that person This feedback loop of increasing attention to that region and genuine orthodontic fuck up only increased my jaw tension I turned to Buddhism and meditation After finishing college I started living at Buddhist monasteries There wasn t much responsibility and there wasn t much social interaction but enough to suffice to the idea of being part of something and moving forward I did this for a few years and became quite a skilled meditator because I was disciplined and motivated enough to only escape to meditation not to videogames and other stuff porn Because I grew up in an upper middle class family the blueprint of being successful is as good as hardwired into me I needed to prove to my family and friends that I could make it and I needed to be good at meditation because it was is the only thing I have faith that has genuinely produced earnest positivity in human beings Well this push pull of western and eastern ideology in your mid twenties is probably going to be a shit show and I haven t proved any different I went as far as becoming a monk for a year and have lived in monasteries for years out of the since I have graduated The other time I spent hiking the Appalachian Trail and moving to DC failing pretty badly at getting off the ground in job or social aspects Now I m and feel like I m being spoon fed a hot coal of bitter medicine Jaw problems aren t just jaw problems Our teeth and bite have a whole shit load to do with how the neck and spine co operate with eachother When things are out of whack with your bite it can throw the entire spinal chain off in ways we don t really understand yet The body is an unbelievably complex and connected machine This has only increased my jaw tension and I had an X ray done for confirmed scoliosis in my back I m and the bitter medicine is that barring a miracle I m not turning this physical decline around That s the gut punch Ever since I ve always thought that I d get through this and be able to communicate and socialize and get pretty girls and do all the things that I was promised That s never going to happen and in all likelihood my body is only going to turn more and more into a prison I don t have any trade skills I don t socialize It just seems bleak when I put it down and lay the facts out I ve been home at my parents for over a month now and my habits are vaporizing I m lost I m paranoid I m unwilling to try new things I can t go forward I can t go backwards and I can t stand still amp x B amp x B,"Cause of Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Positive Coping",medium
It s my birthday in two weeksMobile Throwaway Longer than originally intended and while reading it back realised it sounds like a shit r storytime post so sorry for that I ve pretty much always felt sad for as long as I can remember Not all the time but if there were no distractions my default mood was sad Not necessarily crying my eyes out just low drained unmotivated to do anything I didn t tell anyone about how I felt because that was just normal to me Besides loads of people in their late teens early s say how depressed they are what s so special about me feeling down I worked in a pub for a year starting when I was As an antisocial introvert who finds his energy being away from people this was not a pleasant experience My girlfriend at the time was away at uni meaning between her lectures and my unsociable working hours we never got to see each other The weekend before my th birthday I worked clopens close the night open the morning in a row As I lay in bed after the final shift I felt so empty and alone and sad I accepted that this probably wasn t normal and that things needed to change I couldn t go on feeling sad all the time so I set myself an ultimatum By the time I turned I would be happy or I would be dead This seemed to relieve some of the pressure it gave me something to work towards as well as a finish line I knew it wouldn t go on forever Fast forward about and a half years I was still living at my parents house but I d left the pub and had a couple jobs in between At the time I was involved in stock management for a large national corporation which is to say I worked nights stacking shelves at a supermarket This was not my ambition I didn t really have an ambition but this wasn t it nor did I want to spend more time there than I really needed to so I was looking for other work as well I had applied for a particular job that seemed perfect for me flexible hours short commute ability to work from home if needed fast typing necessary v me on typeracer and find out all in all it felt like a good fit One day after a particularly unpleasant shift the night before I woke up to an email thanking me for my interest but that I was not going to be offered the job Not even an interview I didn t get the chance to show how well I would be able to work in the right environment All the factors that had made me so hopeful that I could get a proper job and do something that would bring me joy while earning a living at the same time gone discarded without a second look It wasn t fair But I didn t have the mental strength to deal with it there and then so I decided not to bother I went to get some dinner breakfast and was greeted by my mother usually very lovely asking all the wrong questions about money jobs my attitude just a lot of stuff that she has every right to be concerned about while I was living with my parents but absolutely the wrong time to ask I snapped at her we both said things we wish we hadn t I left and drove to a place where I could be alone and calm down After a while I went back home my parents were both very apologetic about the situation and I apologised as well I explained what had happened how I was feeling ALL of it and asked if they would help me get help I went to a GP and was diagnosed with clinical depression started on sertraline because who needs a sense of humour or sex drive to be happy Not only this but due to the length of the NHS waiting list my parents paid for me to see a private counsellor Therapy helped me talk and work through some things I d been struggling with for a while and was generally very beneficial I was able to realise that most of what was holding me back came from myself I didn t try new things or meet new people because I was worried that I wouldn t be good enough At least by not trying I d never know for certain maintaining the illusion of adequacy I so desperately needed These realisations came at a time where I ended a pretty nasty relationship came back from a session feeling very emotionally raw and was told the only way to feel better was to get a real job and to move in with her immediately and had secured an interview for a lucrative position with a clear path for progress Not only this but shortly afterwards I met someone else who is funny beautiful understanding and generally very lovely Life was good The antidepressants were stopped over the summer months and I made the decision to not carry on with them afterwards I moved out of my parents house and got a place with my new girlfriend And I got the job I had achieved everything I d wanted building a solid foundation from which the rest of my life could flourish But even now when all the distractions are put away and the world outside the window goes quiet I m still sad I lie less than a foot away from my loving girlfriend yet I m still alone I m years old and I m not happy It s my birthday in two weeks,"Cause of Distress, Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help",medium

"I do not even know what to write here or where to start..Excuse for my English proficiency as its not my first language.For the past 5 years I had toxic parents and I have been in toxic relationships. My way of thinking about life, my will and reasoning were drastic and still are. The way I dealt with deppresion were drugs, cutting my wrist, risking life while walking on the edge of a building. A few years ago I tried to drown myself underneath the ice, hoping that I would not find the exit if I decided to live ( as I was almost drowning I found fisherman's hole through which I was able to break through and survive )I would not call myself dumb as I have created a few businesses (which failed eventually as I did not invest enough time and money) and now work as a programmer in a company which pays me good, but I failed my native language exams. I will not get my diploma and I will not enroll in the university. My mom recently went into psychosis which is not getting better. it is really hard to decide how I feel about that as I hated her most of my life, but we had our moments. My dad seems depressed too, I have two younger sisters and it is really hard to see him and I struggle to take care of them. I keep failing my driving exams. When taking them I start to feel really anxious and just stop the exam as my clutch leg starts ticking uncontrollably.I cannot stop thinking about suicide and my morality about it. I know that I have to support the family, live for my friends too, but it just overwhelms me.Now at nights I just drug myself until I pass out while listening to music and it is the only way I can keep my thoughts away from suicide. I have tried a few psychologist, they did not really help me. I do not know what to do. it is so hard to stay alive.I just wanted to, I dunno, share my pain or just talk to someone.

I m literally hopeless and will end my life in a few daysYes I fucking am There is no hope for me I m sick rn not covid tho and despite that will cut myself anyway I ve lived in a mental hospital for two years I have tried all the kind of therapies they specifically have to offer I m sixteen and we already started trying antidepressants for adults bc I tried the ones that kids are allowed to get already Nothing worked I am almost at the highest dose and after that they can t help me try other ones bc they don t have enough experience My problems are now too complex and heavy for them and they have no other options for me to try therapies again I ve already had for years without success I told them over two months ago I wanted to switch completely and go to another place where they have more therapies and meds I can try and where they are completely focused on ppl like me With chronic severe and complex problems Because at the place I m treated at rn that s just very often not the case so they really lacked acute and good help the first few months They told me they would talk ab it with my parents and me TWO MONTHS later and I told them everything was getting worse and to be able to go in conversation with them my mental health shouldn t worsen I asked them for more temporarily more intense help but they never came back to me so i was left with medication appointments and therapy sessions that didn t help And as i thought everything took a turn for the absolute worst I got worse and worse and i was falling back in all of my bad behaviors and coping mechanisms I cut deeper than ever before didn t do anything and started interacting with my anorexia again that had actually been pushed away and not that bad for the past few months I had the convo a few days ago I didn t want anything because i wanted to die more than ever They said they needed me if i wanted other therapy I told them i didn t want it anymore and i wanted to die They suggested i got admitted to the mental hospital again which is basically of my trauma s I got mad They know that Some of staff treaded me very poorly and multiple friends died there literally doors away from my room They forced me to go inpatient after that and i begged them to send me to another hospital if i had to be on a closed ward everything was better than there But that was too complicated for them So yeah when i got discharged because they couldn t fix me i swore i wouldn t go back ever So they told me if i wanted to be admitted somewhere else i could wait six months Nice thanks Its always so funny they tell me that when i say i want to die and tell them alright fine i ll fk die than And actually attempt And then somehow they have the courage to say wow we were unpleasantly surprised and didn t see this coming LMFAO and THEN i am suddenly transported as soon as im physically ok to the first closed ward with watch Sorry for rhis long rant with bad english I just am so done I tried to tell them i was not ok I tried to ask for help two months ago and again two days ago The only thing bringing me some peace in my mind are self harm and my cat And i tried to hold on for my cat because she means everything to me and for everyone that loves me because i know damn well what its like to lose ppl to suicide But i can t I can t i just can t I can t go to school next year I can t go on a waiting list of six months and i can t go on this way My plan takes multiple days unfortunately and it started yesterday so i have to wait spend my time cuddling with my cat and self harming I doubt wether i should tell my best friend we have an agreement that if the other will end it we will say goodbye and not inform anyone until after I don t wanna lay the burden on her shoulders but otherwise I would ve give everything to have had a chance to say go the ppl i lost I would ve kept it a secret if it meant i could be on the phone with them until they passed I can t bare the idea of them having been so alone God that haunts me the most Knowing they were all alone when they died I don t know guess that s gonna be the last harsh decision to make,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update, Seeking Help",high

What do I do now Had an appointment with my care coordinator today what I assume to be my last appointment after being told despite what the medical evidence supports that he felt that I would get better and am not in need of the service my progression has been slow to naught with even a handwritten note from my last therapy session stating that I do not have the tools to cope with the result of said therapy lowering my depression score by points and increasing my anxiety by My care coordinator arranged a psychiatrist to prescribe me lamotigrine lamictal but i have yet to even touch near my therapeutic dose I haven t been made aware of a plan in an increase of dose and now have been cut off from any known plan All I know is that i ll be placed under the care of a new lesser controlled team to whom I will have to re refer to every time I finish my sessions of therapy I feel that I am not sick enough or not in crisis enough to be worth their time that despite being told to read a self help book my carer did not bother to do the same to research the repercussions of creating an experience in which i feel abandoned and invalidated Ignoring every time I say I m getting worse denying me my right to a written diagnosis while still treating me under a working diagnosis Giving me medication that will kill me and then throwing me off to the curb like it s not a risk I won t save them up to overdose and then creating me a reason to do so What am I supposed to do act on these painful emotions to gain my right to treatment what s the point I d have to repeatedly do so to stay within the system wouldn t be easier to just kill myself not that it s an easy thing to do but it s easier then trying to hurt yourself enough to get treatment and when I think about it in that sense then I really do fit the borderline PD that society hates me for it s bad enough I ve be idealization self mutilation and suicide but now it s becoming the only options as a call for help or an end to the suffering,"Critical Risk, Progress Update",high
Suicidality came back after years of peaceHello I ve struggled with suicidal thoughts since I was years old I m now and self harm since I was as young as or so It comes back in different forms sometimes spontaneous attempts sometimes planned sometimes just an unbearable need to die But I wanted to ask a particular question if we re supposed to have a survival instinct as humans why on earth do I want to die all the time My therapist tells me to say I want to disappear instead of die or I want something to cease or I need a break etc But it s always quite precisely wanting to die I had a good years of barely any self harm or suicidal urges after being in CBT and I just moved countries and was recently diagnosed with PTSD after a huge breakdown and resurfacing suicidality I was just crossing the street and every bridge and rooftop was calling to me Then there was a bus coming my way I was on the sidewalk and I lost touch with reality I had no control over my body and I genuinely had no idea if I moved my body in front of the bus so it runs me over or if I was still standing on the sidewalk I opened my eyes and realized I was alive,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update",high

i feel numbim at the point where i ve concerned my psychiatrist half the staff i deal with in my house and my counsellor almost had to break confidentiality today two days ago i told my psychiatrist that i was have symptoms of psychosis again and told me to book a appointment with him as soon as possible and wants to put me back on meds that i don t like but work for multiple things that he s concerned about today i got a text from one of my youth workers asking of i want to go out shopping for things i need but i told her that i don t want to and that i can t even look at food right now so she asked if i was alright so i told her that i was in a low mood she then asked if i would go to the youth center to talk to her and i told her i would go but i didn t so she came to my house to check on me as i told her before she came that i hadn t gotten out of bed once she got to my place she knocked on my bedroom door and made me come out of my room and talk with her and one other worker to see how i was doing and if i needed and support at the time i didn t need any support i told them after having a conversation with them so they asked if i have had any thoughts of self harm or suicidal thoughts today and at the time i didn t after they left i made myself eat something even though it makes me feel sick to look at food and i can barely keep it down now and have no desire to eat ever and went back to my room and tried to apologize to someone who used to be my friend and see if they could ever forgive me but they said i was the only person they could never forgive and that i only had one chance with them they then listed off everything they hated about me and said a lot of thing that i wish wasn t said but they were i told them that i wanted to kill myself so they never had to deal with me again so they said to not kill myself because of them but they weren t the only reason and i told them that i said that i really was going to act on it so they said well i ll be telling someone about this i said i didn t if they did and that i was in a bad place in the first place so in response to that they said so you won t care if i go tell i said go ahead she may be the only person who could possibly stop me i asked that person why do you care i thought you hated my guts they said i m not gonna sit here and let you kill yourself i texted my counsellor and told him that i was in a really bad place just so he knew even if it was too late to stop me a small part of me didn t want to go through with it and that part is the only reason why i told him then i vaped some CBD in hopes that it would calm me down enough to not act on anything it did the trick till my counsellor could help me and almost called the staff or emergency services as he knows where i live if he couldn t get ahold of staff before i calmed myself i was actually crying which says how bad i was at the time because i haven t been able to cry for months no matter what happened to me and i told my counsellor that i was crying because he knows how bad things must be if i was crying i have a feeling that when i see my psychiatrist and tell him everything that has happened that there will be huge med change or if he sees me as a danger to myself or others hell admit me to inpatient care in the same building but that s assuming that he actually believes me for once sorry this is long but i cant keep this in without getting it out somewhere and if this isnt allowed just remove it and if you actually read this whole this im surprised,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update",high

After trying so hard she s ready to give up everythingEdit I m sorry this ended up being a wall of text out of my own anger I m really not sure where to start with this I m going to explain what I know as well as what I think is occurring My cousin has had a rough year She can t find a job due to job market being crappy she doesn t know what she wants to do for a career she is out of school because of financial trouble and she was diagnosed with a type of cancer that may prevent her from having kids She isn t married but I know she has always wanted to be a good wife and mother someday All of those problems are awful but there is something else that upsets her more Last night I was forced to go to a family event and I spoke with her to kill time I learned that she was still with a guy that she had problems with late last year I don t know what kind of problems I only know that they both messed up and were trying to be adults about it and repair their relationship I thought that was really nice that instead of breaking up they were being reasonable and realistic in order to stay together But I think something else must have happened recently something bad During the time that the two have dated I noticed all of her accounts on different websites disappearing completely Her Facebook disappeared first That one was always pretty inactive so I didn t say anything about it when I first noticed it was gone But she used to post drawings weekly on a few sites and kept a blog for writing and one for photography She also used to frequent Reddit All of those accounts are gone now I thought why she would trash her art and stories like that I felt like I was going to explode if I didn t ask her about it so I hinted at it in conversation She told me My boyfriend thought I relied on the sites for attention I want him to see that I don t She said that with a happy face I couldn t believe that was the reason She drew things she liked for herself she didn t draw things other people liked to gain attention I asked her about the other sites and got similar answers I don t know what has happened between the two I don t know if my cousin ever was an attention whore If she was she certainly isn t now She is nonexistent cautious humiliated and very down on herself I stopped asking her about it and we sat down When she was reaching for a napkin she accidentally tipped over a glass that has a small amount of water inside She stood up to clean it and apologized dozens of times I heard her mumble to herself You idiot You retard She has never had good self esteem but this is a new low I later asked her if her boyfriend has ever called her names She said yes but it was because she always did something to deserve it I can t imagine what All I know is that I would never call someone I loved a retard And if that word ever came out I would apologize immediately I don t know how this man talks to his family and friends but I don t think it s the same way that he talks to my cousin I noticed she has harmed herself physically She has also lost weight Whatever he has said to her it s been bad enough to make her physically ill and stressed enough to harm herself to escape it I used to harm myself and I know how much mental pain you have to be in to do it I can t believe someone put her through that and wasn t worried enough to change how they communicate I had to go to go back to the house the gathering was at to pick up my coat Since her home is in the area I stopped by to ask her if I could see some of her art I figured that might cheer her up I just realized that I forgot to mention her and her boyfriend are in a long distance relationship That is relevant because while at the gathering last night she was asking about jobs from relatives that live in the same state as the guy She had no luck When I got to her house she had about fifty tabs pulled up online for jobs in his area I noticed her room was very bare She used to have posters on the walls stuffed animals on her bed you know it looked like a room someone lived in and liked Now almost every single thing she owns is in boxes and a lot of her personal items seemed to be gone She told me not to worry that it had been packed up for weeks That makes me think that she s been just as stressed for weeks and that s worse As I have said I have no idea what they re relationship is like entirely I know they ve had really bad fights and it s put her in a very dark state of mind But I also know he s flown her out to his parents home and taken care of her during her stay with no problems at all I feel like she will do something drastic if she doesn t get to move If she moves or doesn t she has a lot of healing to do Her self esteem is very damaged I asked her why she was so stressed about finding work she responded He doesn t think I have tried He doesn t think I care for him I do everything wrong I have to do something right I disagree with that If I didn t I wouldn t be posting here I know her boyfriend shows he cares by taking her out to eat and buying her gifts She isn t doing well financially and neither are her parents so she shows her feelings by making amazing art pieces and sewing stuffed animals and key chain characters based off of good memories about their relationship I know he s thrown the gifts in the trash with her in the room I m guessing he s also made her feel bad about the times he s spent money He calls her names and has convinced her she s retarded I can t tell if he has a bad way of showing he cares or if he is the one that has mental problems The breaking point for her seems to be when he says that she doesn t care If she didn t care why would she spend hours on art and sewing Why would all her possessions be in boxes Why would she be applying to every job she can find from a fast food cashier to a janitor I am so confused that she does all of those things and that he flies her out to see him and then says that she doesn t care about him The last thing she said to me was What if he doesn t love me after all of this I won t know what to live for Their relationship none of my business I am just very angry that my smart and talented cousin has been cut down by a man that she wants to be with I think we have all had our feelings hurt by someone we care about But I have never been in a serious relationship so I don t know what to say to her There are two sides to every story but I really don t care what his is I don t think whatever he says could make it okay that my cousin has hurt herself and given up almost all of her hobbies that make her who she is I certainly don t think his story would make me feel that my cousin should die I don t know how to help her She probably doesn t want to talk about the bad parts of the relationship there isn t much I can do to help her find work and worst of all I wouldn t know where to start when helping her build self confidence back up I might ask her to post here if she feels like talking Please don t assume that my cousin has mental issues because of this She is a very caring person probably too caring sometimes I just don t want her to end her life or think that there is no good reason for her to live just because someone she loves thinks it s normal to verbally abuse her like that,"Cause of Distress, Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Progress Update",medium

At first, I just accepted it, but then he just won't shut up about them. Not just with me, but with complete strangers. It was like he viewed it as some sort of badge.
 
 Not to mention that he would always go through a cycle with his diseases: research, self diagnosis, confirmation from friends (by listing out the symptoms of his desired disease and saying he has them), then comfirmation by a doctor (by listing out the symptoms of his desired disease and saying he has them).
 
 You'd think having a mental disorder is a private matter. My mother had depression for my whole life and I never knew until I found the depression pills she hides.
 
 Anyways, this isn't about my friend really. I'm giving him the support he needs (even though it embarrasses me every time he brags about them). Instead, this is about factitious disorder and you. Do you have real mental diseases or factitious disorder? Read all about it below:

I really hate myselfA bit of background I m a sex addict who has been going to therapy for a few months now I ve had a sex addiction problem for about years now but it became so intense over the past years that it lead me to have an affair and cheat on my wife My wife knows about the affair has stayed with me and is attending therapy with me I am not worthy of such love I dishonored her by being unfaithful to her My addiction centers around a hair salon spa fetish in addition to past instances of homosexual activity and fantasy along with transgender fantasy I identify as a straight male I love my wife but I shame her by having those thoughts I feel the hurt others have as someone who has privilege but feel as if me being gone from this earth would help ease the minds of people of color women and LGBTQ as one less straight white male that perpetuates the patriarchy Maybe it would be good if I was rounded up and executed simply for being what I am That is truly what I deserve I don t blame religion if anything its kept me going these past few years I know what Christians and the church say and I m grateful for their love but somehow I know I deserve death deep down for all I ve done and am Even if having those thoughts aren t a sin there is enough that I ve done that would make me unworthy in the sight of a holy perfect God I view myself as a worthless employee at work I work in information security but know far less than anyone on my team let alone my department I hate myself for not being as good as the people around me I am stagnant in my career and think of myself as a lazy son of a bitch who deserves nothing more than to be homeless and on the street My only solace is to drink and masturbate to numb myself to my pain Sometimes I wish I would just drink myself to death Even if family and friends had an initial shock of me being gone it would be temporary and all would move on Where have I gone wrong in all this My wife and my family all deserve a better person such as I The world would be better off with one less straight white male so it gives other people a chance to make something of themselves,"Cause of Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Seeking Help",medium

I feel like everyday is getting harder and harderNow before I say much I wanna establish that I am not clinically depressed because I ve never gone to a therapist and also I think depression is just a little too serious for me to have at the age of I wouldn t like to insult anyone actually having depression by saying that I have depression because I really don t have a reason or diagnosis to think so Anyway I ll give the short note here I was groped by a guy who worked at my house twice and I still cry about it That was years ago My ex boyfriend forced himself on me not fully but enough for me to tell him no and he wasn t listening to me I was also forcefully dragged into a dark alleyway by a friend who was at the time and kissed forcefully and also put in like a physical lock so I couldn t leave I was Plus now I m in th grade and will have to find a college soon but I don t have anh interests I can draw and everyone keeps forcing me to join fashion designing but I don t want to because I don t like it I wanted to be a singer but I cannot sing There s virtually nothing left for me I don t wanna join art or music and I have no academic or political interests That eliminates everything And I m stressed out and to the point where I would rather just die and than to face the disappointing faces of everyone when everyone is off to college and I still haven t figured it out and god knows that they don t take it very well here in India Here you HAVE to go to college after th no exceptions or going after a few years So I m pretty much ready to die Anyway those are just the things that happened to me and I felt weird typing it out to strangers so I hope nobody trolls me lol These things have taken a toll on me through the years as I didn t feel as strongly about them back then as I do now They really make me cry every night and feel disgusted in every single way But these things don t compare to the guilt I feel for what all I ve done to the people I love Well for starters I m very rude to my friends and I make cruel jokes at them They know I m joking but now I just feel bad I feel like they don t like me at all and don t want me around them Secondly I ve broken up a group of friends I had I had a very big group of guy friends years ago my boyfriend and the other guy come from this group and they were all boys and I was the only girl in the group I don t know how or why but suddenly of them had a crush on me Mind you I m not cute at all and like I said I m rude and mean so I really don t know what they saw Anyway one of them became my now ex boyfriend whom I mentioned earlier and I kind of juggled between the other and I feel horrible They eventually because of that reason got jealous and hateful of each other and the group broke up but not in a traditional way We still hung out but it was just not the same anymore Obviously I caused that by being so indecisive and mind my language hoe y Then I broke up with my then boyfriend and got with a friend who had a crush on me from the group and he is the best thing to ever happen to me We are sti together to this day and he really loves me and appreciates me I m not sure about it anymore though You see I am a horrible person and I did a horrible thing to him even though I love him the most and he is the best boyfriend ever We have a long distance relationship and that s important because we usually talk over texts and calls and meet once a month In we moved to another place and I made some friends at school I started talking to this guy as friends because he was my classmate and we chatted once in a while One day the conversation just hit the fan and got really weirdly sexual but we were joking and just laughing about it all Now I realize how weird that was and how it was cheating So anyway a few months ago J wanted my boyfriend to read a chat so I gave him my Instagram password He opened my ID read the chat and we were cool Later though naturally he checked out my ID while I checked out his He found that chat and it s weird because I had a load of conversation after that which was just normal but I don t know and why he scrolled that much into the past that he found it I guess he was already suspicious So he found it and confronted me about it in a very non confrontational way and he said he was very hurt I told him it was a joke and it can be seen in the way the friend and I were replying to each other But obviously he was upset and his trust was broken and I apologized profusely and did everything I could to make things better and eventually everything went back to normal kind of So a few days ago we were chatting as usual and I noticed that since a few days he wasn t like responding to anything sexual about me or like if I sent him a picture or a text like that I asked him and he said he can t tell me the reason but he just doesn t like to sexy anymore because it makes him mad at me I was shattered but I already knew why he was saying that Then after a few days I asked him to tell me the reason and I was right He told me it was because of that thing and I apologised and he said he understands I m not that person anymore but that he just can t do it over text otherwise it reminds him of that and he feels disgusted Understandable I was so very sad and upset and felt guilty all over again But here s the catch since a few days things have gotten somewhat better between us and he assures me that he still loves me but I know he s lying The guilt and regret just keeps on getting bigger and bigger and bigger Now I can t take it and it s not even the fact that he doesn t love me because I know why It s just the fact that I wod hurt someone like him who has helped me through everything I ve described in the second paragraph and has made me a better person the realisation that even though I did not intend to do it I sti very much cheated on my own boyfriend when I preach that cheating is the worst thing ever and the fact that no matter if he leaves me or things get better nothonf will reverse this action of mine and things and trust wi never be the same again That s the worst part it s irreversible Lately the guilt has gotten to the point where I want to die It has mixed with all the experiences and actions of mine from the past and now I don t even want to get better I just want it to end and die There s no solution I don t want a solution I just want out Nobody will care after I die because I ve successfully hurt and betrayed everyone that ever would care Nobody will miss me Nobody even likes me I don t hate my appearance as much but it s not good I don t love myself in any way because of all the things I described All I want now is either a solution as to how I can die painlessly because I m a coward or just a reverse button to everything I just typed to vent and I ve told this all to my boyfriend and he tried his best to reassure me that I m wrong and that whatever I m saying will get better but I know it won t because the only way it can get better for me or for me to make peace with it is that it never would have happened and that s impossible to do There s not way for me only out So I don t know what responses to expect from anyone if I get any that is but just Don t tell me to tell my parents as they won t listen and I don t want to share my private stuff with them as you can see this is all very weird to tell to my parents Plus my brother almost tried to kill himself last year and we are still dealing with his depression to be dealing with mine too Plus my mother is very tired and sad in her life I don t wanna make it worse for her I already do enough of that everyday by being a horrible child Don t tell me to go to a therapist as I can t without my parents and I will have to tell them then which I don t wanna and I don t want to get better as I said before because it won t change anything about my guilt If it was a trauma I wanted to recover from I could but with guilt there s not much to be done Don t suggest trivial things like go out more or talk to your friends and stuff because it doesn t help and if you know how that works you know Please don t make it any weirder than it has to be I was already embarrassed about typing this because of all the things I ve done so please don t say anything to that Don t be mean about my boyfriend or my friends or my family They re all amazing people and you re not anybody to judge them You can criticize them if there is even any criticism over the details I gave but nothing from your side as you don t know them I know all the things I listed are just teenage stuff and all that but I just needed to vent and get some support as my boyfriend didn t do a very good job because obviously he doesn t wanna talk to me anymore So yeah thanks,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update, Seeking Help",high

Confusion suicide and a sick petI ve been having a lot of suicidal ideation It s different this time though because I truly feel I m not meant to be on this plane in existence I finally realize that waiting out this pain is rather pointless because it s going to re emerge again and whatever contentment I find in the spaces between isn t worth the darkness I manic depressive and I can t trust my own brain my mind It s the worst it s ever been this time My cat stopped eating about a week ago He s going downhill and the doctors just figured out what s going on but the situation is dire it s probably too late I don t know what to do Supposedly he has a chance of bouncing back but in the meantime he s on a feeding tube that I have to tend to every hour and a half And any other time in my life I would jump on the chance to help my companion animal get through a hump like this to live But right now well I m suicidal I don t know why am torturing him and torturing me in the process The vet said it s not torture That he looks worse than he is I m not concerned that this vet is bilking me for money believe me He really thinks that if we do the tube feeding for about a week that he could be fine for another three or five or years But I don t want to be here another three or five or years I feel horrible that instead of snuggling with me like he s always done my cat Stays in one spot unless I m coming to feed him and in that case he runs away Like bolts away for me running into things along the way because he has the Elizabethan collar on I don t know if it s good for him or me to keep doing this I don t know if I put him down I might come to me angry that I didn t do everything I could And I don t know if that outweighs the anger I m going to feel if he is deteriorating to a point of no return and his last days with me are horrible I fantasize about killing me and him Why delay the inevitable This pain isn t worth it We could be released from everything Advice,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Seeking Help",high

I was an anti masker and now have Covid If you want to see the rainbow you have to put up with the rain Wearing a mask and social distancing is a small price to pay for things to go back to normal Until a couple of weeks ago I was an anti masker I live in Florida and work in a restaurant and it was only until masks became mandatory in my restaurant after months of not wearing one that I came around and understood the importance of wearing a mask My excuses were that it is hot I am constantly running around and wearing a mask I thought would slow me down and make me uncomfortable The funny thing is I d never actually worn a mask before so I had no real knowledge of what wearing it would feel like Let me tell you all ITS NOT THAT BAD Sure you might get a LITTLE warmer than you would if you weren t wearing it but that is a reasonable price to pay for preserving the safety and lives of others I have taken a complete on this issue and feel guilty for my stance before Let me be clear A mask does not make you immune to coronavirus I work in an overcrowded restaurant and even after wearing a mask every second at work i still tested positive for coronavirus a few days ago Social interaction is the worst possible thing we could be doing right now and I am quarantined in my house with a lot of things to think about How my comfort used to overrule others safety How I used to hate people pushing for masks how annoying it was and now how important it is If anyone reading this would just take a minute to examine what makes their life more important than anyone else s I think we would have a lot more lives saved A mask doesn t make you immune but it does help And refusing to wear one going out partying and not social distancing is a selfish and deadly exercise to partake in I wish you all well and urge you to please wear masks as often as you can and only go outside for things that are truly necessary The lives and wellbeing of those around you and yourself are more important than your body temperature,"Cause of Distress, Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Seeking Help",medium

"I grew up mostly dating men but realized when I was a teenager that I also like women. I know for sure that I am attracted to women, but I go off and on with feeling or knowing if I like men. Do I dislike my male ex’s because they did me wrong or because I forced myself to date men through compulsory heterosexuality?
 A few years ago I did believe that I was a lesbian, then went back to bisexual a year later. Now I feel like I am a lesbian again but honestly I really am not sure.
 I label myself as queer now because I don’t know if I truly fit into the bisexual category or lesbian category.

"DISCUSSIONS OF SEX, SELF HARM AND SUICIDAL IDEATION S
 
 Saturday night, I went out. Already feeling pretty down. Met a woman at the bar. We went back to her friend's house. Then to mine. Had sexual interactions. I couldn't maintain an erection. So, I was left feeling off. She gave me her instagram details and I sent her a follow request.
 
 She left early the next morning. Then last night. I got super drunk. Gambled and lost a bunch. I tried reaching out to a bunch of people. Then, I turned up at her friend's house. Scared her friend, then I left. I had an implement to harm myself on me. I was going to, with the intention of finality, when I saw a message from a friend I'd called earlier. I called him. He talked me down and I went home. 
 
 This morning. The girl who stayed over told me she'd had fun, but what I did was unacceptable. She wanted no further contact and was considering filing a police report. 
 
 I completely agree. I apologised and told her I understood. Then asked if she could contact the police. I unsent that message and she has since blocked me. I'm in minor financial trouble and frankly despise myself. I'm not currently suicidal. I half-heartedly tried something, but couldn't go through with it.",Critical Risk,high

"My (24f) girlfriend and I (27m) recently having been doing some research and talking about how she shows a number of signs of BPD. Thanks to Dr Keith Gaynor's brilliant lecture on BPD we're pretty sure it was her car accident a few years ago that was the traumatic stress trigger that caused her BPD to spiral and it's been very up and down ever since. As you all probably know having this condition, the lows and highs can occur from hour to hour and day to day, and she's in a pretty good spot today and hoping it lasts through the week. 
 
 What makes this most difficult for me is that I don't really know when she's flipped the switch to crisis mode. I can't live my life constantly on the look out for it right now, and any time i'm not fully prepared myself to deal with it, it spirals into a fight between us and that fight almost ruins a whole day for us. Stress about her current job situation means this could be a tumultuous week, and she's also in classes at night. 
 
 We've agreed that the only true solution is finding the right clinician and getting the help she needs, DBT seems promising! But at the end of the day, we're still really new learning about this condition, community, lifestyle whatever you want to call it. As someone who suffers with severe ADHD, from my own experience I felt like it actually got worse when I started learning about it more, it's like your brain can't help but exhibit the symptom you just learned your condition has a tendency to cause. Thankfully I'm in a place where I can support her with her work or class projects if she needs me to when she can't cope, and she's been returning the favor and helping me with my own scatter brain and forgetfulness. We're an amazing couple 80% of the time, and a hot mess 20%.
 
 She won't be able to get professional help at least for another month or so. And I'm truly worried about her and I want to do everything I can to help her navigate her life until then. This weekend was really really rough but tonight she seems to be getting to a better place, so please any tips or things to watch out for to help her not feel in the middle of a crisis every day!

"Hi there, I would very much like to talk to anyone who has done or is doing Transference focused practice for BPD or other issues. I have tried it but haven't found a therapist who is a good fit yet and would also very much appreciate any names of therapists (any area) since it's so difficult to find TFP specialists.
 
 I know TFP is supposed to be a challenging and non-supportive therapy, but so far I've found it very difficult, at times I honestly have felt like I'm going crazy (perhaps from the inherent message you get that you don't know reality as well as the therapist) but I really don't want to self-sabotage and quit.
 
 In case it's interesting to hear my experience, I've briefly seen a female therapist in Mexico who disappeared when she didn't have availability and a man currently in the U.S. who has made me uncomfortable by repeatedly asking me about my sex life (mostly at the beginning but it's hard now because I don't feel I can discuss similar topics since I've been pressured) and who at times comes off as sarcastic, he has no Google reviews but was the only person I could find and is in my neighborhood but all my TFP sessions have been online so I'm happy to talk to anyone in the world.
 
 I'd also love to have an actual phone (or at least text) conversation with someone doing TFP so we could support each other going through it.","Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help",medium

Anyone planning suicide in the long term future I m a depressed F who is considering suicide but not soon but within maybe years Why do I want to kill myself It s kind of a long story But the main reasons are a combination Lack of Economic Stability Health Problems Family along with a lack of purpose or inherent value of life Economic Growing up was hard and I ve had to overcome a lot of adversity lower income household mother dying at a young age being a queer person of color strict parents depression etc like a lot of people here I m in college currently but found that although I genuinely love learning and picked a STEM major college just seems very oppressive I know it makes me sound like an entitled first world millenial My parents made me go the flagship state school directly after high school not allowing me to choose a different school or even CC for a few years I had relatively good grades in high school I knew from the moment I was on campus that I hated it lack of diversity and friendship my health was negatively impacted I didn t have a good sense of direction or idea for a major career and never felt inspired I thought about transferring but didn t have the resources or finances first generation college student so I stuck it out though I was depressed I did well academically but since my major department is kinda shitty applied math I m worried that I won t get a good paying job unlike engineering students Like had I known earlier I would have just majored in that instead I will leave college next year with about K in loans Family Generally I strongly dislike my family life My other siblings went to medical school and basically left the house as fast as they could My mom died at a young age and instead of helping me out as possible with school or becoming self sufficient my dad remarried and spends his money on his new wife unemployed and kids even though he s pretty old and should be focusing on retirement I haven t come out as queer yet but worry that my family will disown me because of it not super religous but super conservative strict and family oriented My parents are also immigrants so we don t have tons of wealthy family here Health I have a lot of chronic probably genetically caused health diseases since I was young When I was young and in my mid teens I was able to take care of them when my parents were employed and supportive After my mom died my dad didn t bother helping me out that much and without the resources for seeing specialists anymore my health has decreased It s hard at college too because I don t have a car and I didn t always have health insurance to be able to see anyone So my health continues to decrease These aren t life threatening health issues but irreverisble for the most part and make me feel insecure and self conscious So because of all this I find it hard to justify continuing life I am kind of a nihilist and definitely an atheist with no absolutely no belief in the afterlife I don t want to kill myself yet but in years when I can be more distant from my family and meticulous in suicide planning once I m in the real world I ve seen many psychologists over the years but rarely find them helpful or knowledgeable and condescending even It seems statistically unlikely that a queer woman of color from a first generation college student background with severly limited family support chronic health issues and student loans to be economically secure in like even years And it s hard to see my straight white male friends from more accepting and upper middle class families succeed in life when it s a constant struggle for me And even if I can push through and somehow find a way through the misery what s the point Why suffer and struggle so much in life if I don t really see a reason too Basically I created this post to see if anyone else agreed with me and is truly planning suicide in the future I m also fine with talking to people about my choices and or expanding on the reasons above though I doubt people can change my mind TL DR Want to wait years before committing suicide Basically I personally see life worth living if I m economically secure have supportive family and friends and am generally healthy However for a multitude of complex reasons all of the above factors are not really possible or likely for me I am also a nihilist atheist and don t see a point to life other than that society has stigmatized suicide and thinks everybody born should continue living,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Seeking Help",high

"So we cut back on my Seroquel and I’ve been doing so much better. Decided we to try propanol for heightened GAD instead.
 
 Last night I decided to take it upon myself to just cut it out altogether. Not sure if it’s just a coincidence or if it’s related but today I’m Uber depressed, very suicidal. I keep ruminating over my behaviors. So much guilt, pain, and feeling like a terrible person. From things like ten years ago but it’s hard to let them go. I write poetry and short form literature to cope. Wanted to share.
 
 I really just want to kill myself today
 
 My stomach is so nauseous
 
 Heightened anxiety
 
 Can’t shake the feeling that I’m a bad person
 
 What if I really don’t care about people
 
 And all I care about is how they make me feel or what they can do for me
 
 That thought is traumatizing
 
 I don’t want to be a manipulator
 
 I don’t want to hurt people or use them for my benefit
 
 What if I can’t ever love and feel real empathy
 
 What if I’ll always be a sad selfish person concerned with my own despair
 
 I don’t even want to tell people how I feel anymore
 
 I’m so sick of saying the same thing and hearing the same shit
 
 A broken record on repeat
 
 I know im annoying, and I don’t want to be a burden
 
 I want to be the reason people smile, to be someones safe haven
 
 But all I ever do is use people
 
 Im haunted by past memories, throwing away friends for male attention
 
 Whoever was a gateway for guys, my drug
 
 Treating people like pawns Just to get my fix
 
 Desperately desiring attention Because it made me feel like whole
 
 I wasn’t a person without someone else
 
 Reminding me of who I was
 
 And sometimes I still feel this way
 Like an addict in relapse
 
 Remind myself I don’t need anyone else
 
 But the emptiness makes me an emotional mess
 
 As long as I have someone to love, to please
 To care for
 
 Or as long as someone else is showering me with the attention and validation I need
 
 Then I’m complete
 
 But without, its like a drought
 
 No idea who I am
 
 Im so sorry, please forgive me

I had a wierd asf dream Basically I was in some scrapyard and then the eclipse happened and I got blinded I ran off to a broken car to fix my view Then a large cat probably a lion came to me It started roaring and I petted it and it went the other way then I went to go inside some tunnel And a fucking Tiger H is there in the middle of the road for some god knows why reason I pet it and it drives into a wall and falls through the world Then I am into some sorta clinic one bit running very fast and I meet my friend who says there are bandits in the building and they release the zoo I continued to go out of the building and down a road When I see a millitary unit running from a bear and a kangaroo There s also a massive pipe room next to me for no reason They plant a bomb to kill the bear and it destroys the street I climbed onto the pipes when beats start climbing after me I parkoured my way into a house and I broke in The bears probably summoned a portal to another universe and the sun was shooting beans into it The house was collapsing and then one girl just whips out a pocket space battleship So we fly to the portal and then I wake up,"Cause of Distress, Positive Coping",medium

"he is under a lot of stress and i knew that, and yet my lack of emotional regulation got in the way and caused a small thing to spiral into a huge argument and panic attack. i feel like the worst person on earth. knowing what he has going on and i could not be there for him, i ruined everything by being demanding and putting my needs and emotions ahead of his when he was struggling. he told me he's disgusted and offended by me and many very hurtful things that i think he said because he was angry. i don't know how to stop spiraling. i am out of distractions and i just want my normal life back. i can't eat, i can't stop crying, i have not left my bed, i need to be productive and go back to school but i just can't manage anything. i feel like there's a massive hole in my heart and a massive void in my life. i hate feeling such extreme things, anyone else can move on from a breakup but i am just begging and pleading and apologizing to him to let me make things work. i feel pathetic and mad at myself and at the same time i would still do anything to have things be like they were a week ago. any advice or kind words would be really appreciated",Mood Tracking,low

I wrote an abomination D Dr Blivious Brainwits was a man who liked tall women likely connected to his long standing slenderman fetish He sat alone at his booth staring across the club at his desired woman She too was sitting alone at another booth drinking a glass filled with some red liquid Blivious wondered what it was Perhaps I should ask her he thought It could serve as an excuse to introduce myself With that he gulped down the remainder of his beverage which was a strong mixture of whiskey and soy sauce It was an acquired taste but quite a good one for those capable of enjoying it He slid out of the booth and weaved his way clumsily through the crowd of club goers dancing to the emo trap bangers that the dj kept playing The track currently being played was pure fire a song called Helena Remix by My Chemical Romance and Metro Boomin featuring Savage The doctor soon found it difficult to tame his hips which had an incredible desire to begin swinging to the beat He pinched himself on the back of his left hand reminding himself of the task at hand the woman Nothing else mattered With newfound confidence he found himself able to resist dancing to the infectious club banger He walked over to the booth of the young woman and sat across from her May I ask madam what you are drinking He said smoothly speaking in a heavy British accent He flashed an awkward smile revealing his polished white teeth and unhealthy blood red gums The contrast was frightening He winked at her Take a sip she said as she pushed her glass towards Blivious He took it and had a short sip It tasted strongly of ketchup It was a local brew the Ketchbrau a ketchup infused beer The doctor raised one eyebrow and proceeded to gulp down the rest of the Ketchbrau in seconds Um sir The woman began That was my Yes yes Blivious waved his hand dismissively I shall buy you another madam he said with a strong Russian accent Tis will only take a moment m lady He stood up and went towards the bar As he walked he bulged his chest feeling prideful about the progress he had made with the woman All signs were looking good One Ketchbrau over here kind sir He cried at the bartender who nodded in response Actually he added Make it two Ketchbrau After receiving the drinks Blivious returned to the woman s booth He slid one drink towards her and she sipped it slowly as she eyed him suspiciously So she said I d appreciate it if you d introduce yourself She squinted at him Very well madam He said with a heavy French accent The woman frowned at the sudden accent change You are speaking to the widely acclaimed Dr Blivious Brainwits I have a Ph D He smiled Charmed yet madam He smiled even wider His gums appeared to stretch almost as if they may split in half It was frightening The woman frowned even harder making it appear as if she now had a unibrow So now that you know my credentials madam may I know yours He pulled a wooden pipe from his pocket and brought it to his lips He lit the pipe and began sucking down the fumes of the poison ivy he was smoking Not a single trace of smoke escaped from his lips He felt his lungs burning within his chest Seeing this the woman frowned further still her forehead becoming wrinkled and distorted from the effort Her forehead looked like that of an old woman I m uh call me Lindsey Lindsey Cocksworth She said still frowning Cocksworth Asked Blivious surprised Cocksworth sounds like a good sign he thought He smiled to himself Erm no I mean yes she blushed Blivious pulled his pipe from his mouth and put it to his nose inhaling the fumes It tickled the inside of his face Lindsey frowned even further her forehead contorting beyond what should have been humanly possible It was a horrible sight to behold Interesting surname madam May I ask of its origins He raised one eyebrow taking on a sensual and suggestive expression Well the woman suddenly stopped frowning and began smiling instead Want to find out doctor She winked Blivious suddenly felt something bulging in his underwear It was a sensation he hadn t felt in a long time Oh madam he gasped That is quite the suggestion I just may have to take you up on that offer He shifted in his booth leaning in closer to the woman Gladly Blivious sped down the street in his Lamborghini Corvette hybrid the Lamborvette It was a custom vehicle of his own design Lindsey sat in the passenger seat singing along to every emo trap banger that came on the radio She had been singing along to DaBaby s BOP Remix featuring Gerard Way and Travis Barker when they pulled into the doctor s driveway Blivious stepped out of his car and began walking towards the front door Lindsey close behind He slid the key in opening the door and turned to watch Lindsey as she walked towards him Despite the darkness of the night he thought he could see something protruding from between her legs Blivious blinked and rubbed his eyes thinking he was imagining things Lindsey walked into the house with the doctor who shut the door behind them The woman instantly pushed Blivious onto the couch asserting her dominance She let out a low inhuman growl Blivious was lying on his back looking up at the woman as she stripped her clothes off He smiled at her Until he saw her cock It was a massive juicy thick hunk of meat far beyond the length and girth of the average penis It was almost two feet long and several inches wide Blivious was about to stand up and run away but Lindey s growls intimated him and he dared not make a move As she growled he suddenly realized that her mouth was not moving He looked at her penis and realized the head of the penis had a mouth reminiscent of that of a dog Ma mad madam Blivious stuttered You you Silence She cried speaking from both her mouth and her penis at the same time The voice coming from her mouth was shrill and high while that of her cock was low and gritty They spoke in perfect unison I did not sign up for this madam He yelled using a heavy Nigerian accent GrrrrrrRAOW the penis said The woman looked down and began patting her penis as if it were a pet Shh she whispered to her cock Her cock grumbled in return Seeing her distracted the doctor made a run for it He rolled off the couch and quickly got to his feet sprinting to the door He had almost made it No No Madam you can t I can she said as she dragged him by his leg back towards the couch She let out a sinister cackle Nothing will stop me Blivious whimpered in despair as Lindsey tore his shirt off She began gripping and yanking on his pants struggling to pull them off as he squirmed desperately on the couch Her cock was now fully erect it s length almost five feet as it angled diagonally upwards Strangely enough however her balls were a normal size Lindsey had now ripped off Blivious s pants and underwear revealing his erect three inch dick She gripped her own penis and angled it down towards his The mouth of her penis licked it s lips preparing to give Blivious a penis to penis blowjob as tears streamed down his cheeks Her medium sized boobs began bouncing up and down by themselves as if they had a mind of their own Her nipples suddenly cracked and opened into two tiny mouths squealing excitedly Suddenly when he thought all hope had been lost Blivious had an idea He looked over towards his Amazon Echo device resting atop a table in the corner of the room Alexa He yelled Play an emo trap banger Lindsey s penis lips were only an inch away from his cock when his speakers began blasting music catching her off guard and startling her The song that began playing was WAP Remix by Cardi B and Jonathan Davis featuring Machine Gun Kelly Instantly Lindsey leapt back and away from Blivious She began uncontrollably bucking her hips front to back and side to side falling victim to the club banger Noooo She cried in protest as she began flailing and bouncing uncontrollably around the room in time with the music Ha You have been bested madam Said the doctor speaking in a thick Southern accent N not not possible Lindsey screamed Tis quite possible indeed madam He said as he stood up He put his clothes back on while the woman continued dancing uncontrollably Her penis was no longer erect and had gone back to being only three feet long and dangling He pulled his pipe from his pocket and began smoking The woman was now curled up in a ball in the corner of the room struggling to try and stop herself from dancing Blivious walked up to her and shoved his pipe up her penis mouth It howled in pain as it was lit on fire and began burning from the inside out By the time the song ended Lindsey was little more than a burnt up crusty corpse Blivious put his hands on his hips and smiled to himself Another job well done,"Cause of Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Mental Distress, Positive Coping",medium

"Since I began seeing a therapist 5 months ago I have realised the thought of being happy genuinely terrifies me, and I do not even really know why. I think its probably caused by multiple things. If I had to guess, I think I just do not feel like I deserve to be happy. I have hated myself for so long that maybe I have found comfort in my misery, like its my punishment or something. And in a related way, I think I am scared of my happiness being selfish. Having been miserable for so long, I think Id feel like a selfish asshole if I suddenly got over my issues and starting liking life when I know there is countless people in the world still feeling how I did. And furthermore, its only in the last while have I really begun to take my problems seriously and have been trying to be more sympathetic to myself, but even now with all the shit I am going through its like I can still barely take care of myself. And its like I am afraid of losing the various anxiety issues and what not that make me miserable, because if I lose only them and not my self-hating mindset, Ill have even less reason to sympathise with myself. Ill be some privileged selfish asshole and be even harder on myself than I have ever been.Lastly, I think I am just afraid of the thought of living in general. Death just seems soo simple and peaceful, and I think I have become fixated on the idea of dying. Having been miserable for so many years I think the idea of any more life terrifies me. because even if I did make an amazing recovery, Ill still get new problems, which could be just as bad or worse, and I could also relapse and redevelop all my anxiety and insecurity issues. In fact I have before, in 2018 I made huge strides and then in 2019 it all turned to shit again. And a lot of it was because I had one panic attack in front of an entire class in school, in front of most of the new friends Id made in 2018 who did not know I was an insecure, anxiety ridden loser with no friends before I met them. It pretty much shattered any progress I had made, and thereafter I had multiple panic attacks in school, making it even worse.Those are my interpretations anyway. Whenever I feel like I am making any progress on myself it sends waves of panic through me.

"Ok I'm a 22 year old guy. In 2014 I began to improve my diet. I just stopped eating junkfood, sugar, no sodas, and just water and 3 solid meals a day. Eventually a few weeks after that I felt like a god like I woke up for the first time. Before this my mood was worse and so was my diet. Anyway my libido was never better, I lost fat, physical strength seemed to increase, mood very balanced and energy was great! I wasn't even workingout then. Even on days were I didn't sleep to good I still felt phenomenal. I enjoyed doing things in the yard and my irritablility was nonexistent, but occasionlly I'd eat sugar, or drink a beer here and there but thats it. This lasted to about thanksgiving last year. I lost selfcontrol and fell a slave to the holiday foods. Especially Christmas. So yeah I picked up pounds and my libido decreased and my energy but my mood was decent still. This last till about early March this year. So last month I cleaned my diet up or tried to. Heres the thing, I just got a job in March and pretty much I leave early in the morning and come back late at night, and I have to repeat next morning. I wasn't able eat too much. I still ate 3 times a day but I didnt have time to eat a large amount. Ever since then, my mood has shot down, my libido has gone down, now I'm irrationally angry and depressed for no reason! Homicidal thoughts and occasionally suicidal. Like I wanted to drive this lady of the road this morning for cutting me off and flipping me off and I didn't even care she had a kid with her, but luckily I maintained control and I got over it quickly. My mood bounces like crazy, I can be happy talking with a friend and then after they leave hours later, I'm depressed, then I'm wanting to kill someone, then I see something funny or distracting that puts me in a temporarily good mood. I already had an episode of me yelling outside earlier because I didn't want to break anything in my home. Last week I wanted to attack some guy just from snoring on the bus, this is a new type of anger for me. My muscle mass has decreased, I feel a bit weaker, somedays or moments I feel lethargic, hating life and fatigue others I don't, even if I sleep good I'll still feel tired even if I wake up with a good mood. I do notice I get a temporary mood boost while and after I'm eating but feel fatigued sometime after. I was thinking maybe I wasn't eating enough because I know restricting calories can cause a few issues. I changed jobs, now I'm working with my uncle who has a much better work schedule. I'm putting a bit more food on my plate thinking I'd go back to my old self, but no help at all. I don't know if I'm still not eating enough, I did increase the amount of food though. I'm not sure if this is a mental issue or a nutritional one. I'm not going through anything that would cause me to be this angry for no reason. Nothing in my life has changed except my eating habit which I'm fixing. I'm sleeping way better, and again no junk or sugar. Even years ago when I ate like crap, I never experienced this. If this not a lack of calorie issue, then WHY now? Why all of a sudden do I feel a drop in everything, I mean back in 2014 I fixed my diet felt fantastic, I get a little loose with it, try to fix it again now this is happening. I'm confused. From what I remember, I don't think I'm eating much less than I was last year, also I'm less social, like I'd rather stay in than hangout. I never was a huge social person but I still enjoyed the occasional outing. Sorry if this is long, again I'm just extremely lost here and confused as to what the source of this could be. Could being overweight cause this?? I've been obese before and it's not a thing new to me. Thanks.",Miscellaneous,low

"Abilify (Aripiprazole) has shown some clinical effectiveness in treating borderline personality disorder.
 
 And let me just say, these magic little tic tacs have made a world of difference for me, when combined with therapy and my antidepressant. A year ago, my romantic relationship was particularly triggering, and I was prone to episodes of rage and self harm. I felt horribly inadequate, alien and at a constant risk of being abandoned.
 
 Nowadays, my moods are steadier, without any sense of being ""zombified."" It feels like I have a chance to practice some self-soothing exercises when I'm feeling triggered, as opposed to suddenly flying into blinding, red-hot fury or a suicidal spiral of desperate sadness. My self perception is also a lot more rational- I still see my faults, but they don't seem world-ending, anymore. The people around me seem more accepting, trustworthy and empathetic. 
 
 Even if they're not prescribed Abilify, I highly recommend that anyone who is feeling ""stuck"" in their current treatment speaks to their psychiatrist about treatment options. I had to specifically ask about them, months after my diagnosis, to start the conversation.

"My boyfriend and I have been together for five years. As long as I've known him, he's had slight schizophrenic episodes... They come in waves. He will become horribly depressed and tell me he hears voices in his head coaxing him to kill himself or hurt himself, and while he isn't necessarily inclined to do it, they are loud and persistent... In addition, he says he will often remember a phrase he heard earlier in the day and repeat it in his head for hours on end. He says he sees black shadows in the corners of his eyes and when the lights are off, he will see them in plain view. These episodes are accompanied by insomnia. I also found out a year ago that he is bisexual- I am as well (I'm female, to put it in perspective)- and I now understand that with these episodes, he will go from the very straight side of the spectrum directly to the other side, telling me that girls begin to repulse him and that he loses feelings for me. All this occurs about once a month and subsides after four or five days, after which he goes entirely back to normal. This may be a far stretch, but I feel all these things are connected... We checked, and his family does not have a history of mental illness. If I didn't mention this already, he is twenty years old, which I know is when mental illness can pique. I don't expect anyone to be able to fix him but I'd like to know what is going on with him and if it's been seen before. He refuses to go see a therapist so this is all I've got.

Telling my parents I m suicidalHi F here I want to die why else would I be here I burst into tears at sports practice there s a voice in my head constantly harassing me I fantasize about my death and how it would affect others every day I want people to miss me I want everybody to realize how much or little I mean t to them I know this isn t healthy or normal I m seeing a therapist now which is neat My parents brought me to therapy at my request but I didn t tell them what for I don t want to give them the burden I don t want to explain why I feel so bad to them My parents lead very busy stressful lives as it is They work in law which is a tiring field to be in The family dog is sick and lethargic right now They re redoing the house and have to make a lot of decisions There s so much stuff on their plates right now I don t want to distract them from it and add more to worry about I don t want to break my mom s heart I ve told them before I felt like I want to end my life but quickly took it back saying I would never do it and I was being hyperbolic But that was months ago and now it s getting worse Sometimes I really do think about doing it ideas like hanging myself on a basketball hoop structure at school or tying my feet to a heavy concrete block or rock to drown myself in the pool pop into my head often I m starting to get scared I will really do it someday It gets overwhelming sometimes at school and I spend my lunch period crying I used to blame it on just being a dumb angsty teenager but it hurts a lot now I told my therapist my first time going was two days ago and she listened It was nice the thing is I can only see her like once a month since her schedule is so busy It got worse after I talked to her about it and it kinda sucks that I have to wait until May to discuss it more I have a meeting with a psychologist for medicine which I m kinda worried about I don t want any scary side effects who knows maybe I m just being dramatic and I don t really need it I don t want to tell my friends I m sure they have a lot to deal with too in their lives and I don t want to scare them away It s not like therapy anyways where they re bound by law not to tell anybody I don t know what to do I don t feel good,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update",high
The only reason I have not killed myself is because I don t want to be selfish but I really want to do it For the past years I ve wanted to kill myself but I don t want to hurt the lives of others I know that if I killed myself I have friends and family that would be very upset and would wonder if there was anything they could have done to stop it So I guess it s good that I recognize that I have made some impact on others but that s not the issue here I just don t want to live I don t like life I know that if I were more optimistic I could maybe have a better life but I ve tried being optimistic and that doesn t work out either because I always end up disappointed I ve gotten to the point where I m just faking life I do what I need to do to fit in I know it s been five years ish since I ve felt this way but I m wondering if there will ever be a point that I just say screw it and do it I also attempted once about years ago when I first started having these thoughts and one of my close friends no longer close helped me out and stopped me from completing my already started actions So yeah I realize that other people would be disappointed But I want to do things for myself Well I guess by that I mean that I want to do this one thing for myself I hope that was coherent Your thoughts reactions would be appreciated,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk",high

It s All My Fault No it isn t Yes it is I m in a strange emotional state right now I don t know how I should be starting my story I don t know what I m supposed to say But I ll try to make it as clear as possible My house has never been one to display much affection Thats not to say we don t love each other or someone is overtly abusive but emotions are not shown very often do I care too much or maybe I don t care at all and I m faking it As a result communication is a major issue and it strains relationships often Another thing to note is that my brother and I are first generation here parents were refugees from Viet Nam My father never graduated high school He began working early and came over to the states as a group sponsored by a church All his life he has done manual labor of some sort and currently works as a mechanic at a self owned although beginning to fail mechanic shop Despite all this he will never ever pass by an opportunity to help someone whether it is through money work or otherwise In my eyes he is practically a saint despite some minor flaws gambling which he has fixed and a little bit of drinking This is because no matter what he will help and expect nothin in return He sees everyone as being equal and will do anyone a favor with a smile on his face even though it may end up costing him Throughout my childhood he was and still is working six days a week from AM to PM at the shop and sometimes even as late as PM He works all day and he works hard even though the business is meager he still does all he can to contribute whatever he can towards our home Because he worked so much I could never see him often and as a child I always saw him as a kind of distant figure that deserved all my respect but I never quite knew why Of course now that I have grown older I fully understand how much he has sacrificed throughout the years in order to give my brother and I what we wanted and what we needed growing up I love him more than words can explain for it and my absolute biggest regret is not spending more time with him and being closer Don t get me wrong he s still healthy and alive but I just wish I could get closer to him but I dont know how At all And it kills me My mother was one of the boat people that fled Viet Nam leaving her parents when she was only At only a week out to sea however her boat was caught up by a Chinese Hong Kong patrol boat and all the members on board were sent to a detention camp in Hong Kong Thankfully because this was towards t he end of the conflict they were able to negotiate her and the others release and passage to America due to political asylum or something I can t recall When she arrived living with her aunt uncle who were already here at the time her first order of business was to get a job and finish high school After that she perservered and went on despite having limited English skills to graduating both college and pharmacy school to become a pharmacist Again my mom is the type of person to go out of her way to help people even if it costs her as evident to the tens of thousands of dollars we constnatly wire back to Viet Nam to aid relatives However she has a quick temper And I mean quick On one hand I guess you could say I m closer to my mom than my dad since she had more education so I could talk with her with more advanced topics and for some reason I could just chat with her better in general but on the other I just felt that there was always a kind of barrier between us as if I had some understood yet unspoken relationship with my dad that I just didn t have with my mom I know this is getting long and I doubt anyone will read it thoroughly I just want to note that at this point I have mostly calmed down and my thoughts are getting more lucid However I feel like writing this is something that I truly need to write to let it out Furthermore the nature of my issue is something that has and probably will recur constantly so while I am in control of my thoughts I figure pre is better than post As you can see from my descriptions I hold both of my parents in very high regards to the point where when I was younger and to a certain extent even now I could see them do no wrong Growing up everything I did I did it to make them happy to please them to constnatly seek their approval And even now I see nothing wrong with that especially when I consider that everything I have now is because they gave up on their dreams or sacrificed their goals in order to provide And I am truly eternally grateful I feel like it is a debt that can only be repaid by living my life through and raising my own children providing them with the same albeit unspoken love and care that my parents have shown me I have learned so much as a person from each of them the foremost being the importance of family and love from my father and the necessity of knowledge determination and respect from my mother Again I cannot fully encompass the gratitude I have towards them and the debt that can never be repaid However this is where the problem begins Even at a young age if my parents ever fought each other or got mad at me or my brother regardless of fault I would blame myself I would not tell them I blamed myself but in my heart I felt that whatever unhappiness that was visited upon them was my fault And thus I always strove to do as they told and avoid upsetting them This worked fine until I d say starting about or years ago when family issues began cropping up As I mentioned earlier my mom was quick to anger and had very low tolerance for mistakes or disrespect My dad is very quiet and softspoken and often will take t he blame in order to diffuse any situation For that respect him immensely Seriously His ability to maintain composure was astounding When my brother began to reach that age where everything and everyone is out to get you a lot of fights broke out in the family because my brother thought my mother was too overbearing and my mother disliked how disrespectful and americanized my brother was becoming Needless to say fights often ended in tears while my father was trying his hardest to calm everyone down and I sat isolated trying to maintain composure but of course blaming myself and trying to find a way to keep the family together As I said earlier from my dad I developed a kind of do everything I can mentality towards my family I refused to become a broken statistic The fights grew in number and volume my brother became more rebellious my father began getting tired etc etc Fast forward to the present I know this is getting long and to be honest everytime I write something I realize I have more to write but keep in mind this is nearly two decades of bottled up emotions that no one has heard

"CW: alcohol, sex, self harm 
 
 I’ve been binge drinking since I was 15. That’s just what you do here as a young person. Right away I think I didn’t have a good relationship with it. Back in highschool I used to drink to numb the pain. But I started noticing patterns like I probably had sex 99% of the time I binged. 
 
 I’ve been through the whole shebang with drinking. Fighting with friends and family, running away from home, unprotected sex, online shopping and dropping cash without a second thought. Trying drugs without second thought. Missing events and work. Cutting when I’ve been clean for months. I once shredded my legs to pieces at my own house party because someone hurt my feelings.
 
 When I drink, all the darkest parts of me come out. My inhibition is insane. It’s like my BPD is just sitting there waiting tor me to drink. I never pass out, I want to keep going. I become a huge fucking people pleaser. I know an issue of mine is I want everyone to like me. I want everyone to think I’m cool and awesome and the best. When I drink I will do anything to seem “chill”. Often this involves acting out of character. I will over share to death. I’ll get flirty just to try to seem desirable.
 
 I’m 23 now and in most aspects of my life I’m thriving. I have a healthy relationship, an apartment. Nearing the end of a bachelors degree. I want so badly to be a good person. I think I am a good person, I just have this fucking demon. The anxiety I have after a night of drinking is insane. It can last weeks. My boyfriend is extremely kind and understanding but that doesn’t stop my guilt. I wouldn’t want to be him. This part of me makes me feel unlovable. And I don’t want something to happen I can’t come back from. And i’m so tired of this anxiety. It makes me want to end my shit more than my bpd. 
 
 I’ve had therapists want me to go to AA and it’s just pissed me off. I always think I’m so young or it’s not like I’m drunk all the time. But now my psychiatrist wants me to go. And I’m breaking. I’m wearing myself down.","Critical Risk, Maladaptive Coping",high

Very calm now yet I m still done I know I have a history of irrational and suicidal thoughts I m convinced that I am bipolar with mixed episodes though I ve never been diagnosed I m used to the racing thoughts and self loathing and I ve called the suicide hotline before in those acute situations I ve been working on my calmness lately meditating and working on developing mental self discipline Apparently I m good at it I can drop my heart rate at will using only a relaxing thought now But the thought of suicide persists and now it has become a very calm very rational thought Before it was I can t get through the night feeling this way which was of course untrue it was tough but I got through all those difficult nights Now it has become a very rational I have nothing to look forward to that s worth the numbness I have to feel to get there Background Lower middle class white male I know I m just the worst believe me I squandered much of my youth because of bad luck and depression lost my job in right before the crash and stayed mostly unemployed for five years Never went to college even though that would have been the perfect opportunity my parents had the money to help me out I was just too depressed and obsessed with the notion that it would end soon and I would be back on my feet Finally got a job a few years back nothing special but it was full time and not a month in the girl I had dated for six years the love of my life and the only person I ve ever felt like I could connect with on every level dumped me only to reveal afterwards that she had been abducted raped and left in a parking lot two years before and she d been living with the weight of that event solely on her shoulders ever since She d never told a soul never went to the hospital or police or therapy just tried to live her life like normal until it finally crushed her I tried to be there for her and for my trouble I got to see her getting into escorting violent and degrading sex drinking and other destructive behavior She broke into my house one night for a booty call and made me hit her and hurt her and say cruel things to her and I did it because I wanted her in my life in any way but I felt horrible violated and told her I couldn t do it again We lost touch after she attacked me in my house one night destroyed several priceless possessions and called the cops to tell them I was responsible I only barely avoided jail She s a cam girl still and I follow her even though it hurts just to see how she is She s doing okay now emotionally and I consider that a blessing I still love her and I always will After that I got into drugs drank a lot tried to destroy myself I got into many bar fights had a lot of promiscuous sex including two affairs with friends who were in long term relationships that I almost ruined I let myself be raped by two co workers male and female because I felt like I deserved it after what had happened to my ex You might not consider it rape I never said no but I let things happen that I didn t want and that made me feel violated As a result of that I was left with persistent intrusive thoughts that have left me impotent with lovers until I tell them what happened basically a death sentence for casual sex I moved across the country last year to try to escape my past and start over and it hasn t worked As much as I work on myself my relationships with people seem to go the same way I have no trouble finding friends I m pretty charming one on one but I can t seem to keep them around I have no terrible attracting women but they all seem to get spooked a few months into the relationship I feel like my baggage is too much or that it makes me incapable of accepting their love I just broke up with a girl and even though we dated for only three months I felt such a strong connection I told her everything and she not only accepted it she had some stories of her own Every moment we were together I felt alive again but for various reasons relating to her social awkwardness I didn t get a good introduction to her social circle and I think she didn t feel like I could be a long term part of her life That triggered a spiraling depression for me that only bolstered her resolve to push me out of her life This has happened so many times It just all seems so pointless I know I ll find new friends but they won t stay long I know I ll find new lovers but they ll all leave me with nothing special to remember them by I want nothing more than a life that feels meaningful where I can build a history with the people I love but I

Another depressed guyHello hi I feel like shit and I ve decided to share my story At first I need to say I don t wanna give too much personal info in case someone I know came across this I m in my early s I ve been sort of a recluse for most of my life clumsy bullied at school etc Most of my childhood and teens passed by as I was playing video games or killing time in some other way A couple of years ago I decided to change it and live a normal life which ended up in a failure Not so long ago I discovered that there are several things wrong with my body After an extensive google research I ve found out that I have numerous birth defects usually associated with some syndrome that s not the case Most of them aren t really serious if you saw me on a street you probably wouldn t notice anything However one of them hampers my ability to practice sports what may explain my clumsiness and the other one my sexual life that is if there was one Also one of them seems very rare since I couldn t find anything like that on the internets And the whole combo is just mind blowing for me I ve sought medical help but it seems the only thing that could help explain my issue would be some form of extensive genetic testing I know that there are people with full blown syndromes who have it worse than me but still it feels bad and strange And as a consequence I feel very odd it s difficult to explain as if I wasn t really a human And no I m no hypochondriac Apart from my physique I m pretty detached from people on the social plane I must admit I m quite bright and sensitive artsy and find no interest in popular culture I can think of one person I feel comfortable talking with but she doesn t seem to give much shit about me I expect too much I don t want to die but life is just a burden for me I can t recall a moment when I was happy If there isn t any sort of compulsion to do something I could lie in bed the whole day long The only thing that keeps me alive is probably music I m a bit into literature but the stories are about normal healthy people or with some well described diseases however strange may it sound and I can t identify with that Also I m an atheist but even if it turned out god exists I would consider him an asshole for making his children s lives so shitty Also I get restless easily and can t really relax something is always bothering me I m seeing a psychologist who seems to know his job and I have past experience with mental care people but it doesn t seem to fix my life and the world as a whole I would like to say that I feel better after spitting it out unfortunately I don t Anyways it s nice if you didnt tl dr this,"Cause of Distress, Mental Distress, Positive Coping",medium

This is my experience on thinking about suicide and being dobbed in so that my workplace gets involved part This has just happened to me today Staying home from work and I got an email from work that just made me go bitch pleeassseee Work conflicts basically caused me to become mentally ill to the point that when I get frustrated with them self harm thoughts come hand in hand with any irritation or anger It s not that I plan to kill myself but instantaneously I think in my head I want to kill myself and immediately next thought I would think OMG don t be stupid that s not going to happen That sort of goes backwards and forth until I get very worked up It feels crazy in my head and it feels I need to vent The problem here is now I don t really care about anything asides from basically bitching to someone What happened today was I bitched to a friend at work via my personal email and their work email I do say friend because I m not venting to them because it s my best friend or anything it is someone who I know personally from work and knows about other instances I thought about self harm at work and isn t very trustworthy as you are about to find out I bitch a bit and told him what I was thinking at that moment which had bits of people are lying to me again I want to kill myself I feel faint so forth Not the first time I told him that in fact I told him I locked myself in the bathroom at work because I got scared I ll self harm if I went outside and he did nothing Literally nothing He read it and didn t even check that I was alright or not or come to check on me I was literally just upstairs Anyways the point of that side story is that this is normal So back to the main story I wrote those emails early in the morning then went home and watched some TV and went to sleep After lunch my parents started phoning me up saying work contacted them and work phoned the police OK sure Not the first time work phoned the police on me and fuck them The police came What they knew was Work has phoned them telling them that I sent an email saying I d self harm suicide and they were worried because I haven t sent them anything since so they have not been in contact and they were worried if I was alive They have mixed in some truths with lies I sent an email true The bit where they make a big deal out of it a lie I had no phone calls or emails from them that day really they could ve contacted me if they wanted to However they did phone both my parents who said they were in contact with me and did not want them to phone the police and make a big deal out of it The point is I was fine I got taken to hospital for a check up and got let out the same day so the doctors didn t think there were reasons to keep me there even though they could ve done so against my will There are going to be people who hide behind a facade of care or worry who says they are doing things that they are not It s hard to tell most people want to be loved so they want to believe what they are being told is true but when you feel worse after hearing about it then something isn t right It s just better to trust your instincts People can let you down or betray your trust I m slowly getting used to people who think they can mix in some lies because people would believe them over someone like me someone with a history of mental illness seen a psychologist Those stories might be enough to send the police to your place and have you sent to hospital for an assessment but the police literally can t do anything else it s the doctors who decide Doctors at the hospital aren t going to just blindly listen to that story and going to the hospital doesn t mean that they ll keep you there against your will Why did my work place decide to lie I don t know They could be genuinely worried they could be covering their ass in case of legal problems or they could want to put me in my place for being a nuisance It really doesn t matter They can say you are mental but they are just as mental as themselves As for my friend I am still coping with the fact that he would care more about the company than my wellbeing I honestly do believe if I died he d shrug it off I ve told him I was feeling suicidal endless amounts of times before but getting personal messages like whatsapp not just emails forward off to work Part of not being about to cope makes me think about self harm want to kill myself wanting them to watch me die wanting him to regret not helping me What gets to me the most is that he pretends he is above fault I had a panic attack in front of him and he walked away telling me I should get help He did that more than once actually At the same time he s pretending he s a good guy who cares and will help when shit hits the fans He is like a human version of the workplace If I can kill myself I d make sure he gets haunted by it I used to get so upset when my workplace lied and then think about suicide even more thinking I could get back at them,"Cause of

Worried about someone i met at works bar I work at a hotel bar and this evening had a chap come back after being out for the day drinking Though he had clearly had a fair bit to drink he was mostly still in sound mind for the first few hours of our chat It quickly became apparent that that he was carrying a lot of baggage PTSD childhood abuse and a few other things He is the father of someone i went to school with about years ago Have not seen any of them in that time appart from passing in the street so he felt like he could open up a little when telling me the stories but also was very stern that the conversation was between us two and no one else He spoke about the several doctors and psychologists he had visited over the years being of no help as they just kept trying to get him to move on He then described someone under his watch being killed while explaining that something like that cannot be forgotten or put out of mind I did not so much speak but rather listened to his story and what he had to say Honestly i was very overwhelmed and could not even begin to know how to reply and he mentioned several times that he had considered jumping off a near by bridge or walking infront of a train several times in the last year I think much of this is due to him having no one he feels he can talk to at home and clearly feels he is a burden on his wife over the last years He left his phone number and said that the chat had made him feel the best he had felt in months and would like to chat again Here is the problem and i feel like utter scum even thinking this way but i do not have the time or the knowledge to possibly be on call for something like this and do not know what to do If i pass his number on or try to contact his family will it destroy any trust he may have when talking to people about this But at the same time just leaving it and hoping the it was the alcohol talking is not an option as he was able to have a well thought out talk Sorry if this is a bit of a mess its fairly early late in the morning and i am still at work any advise would help Thanks,"Cause of Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Mental Distress, Positive Coping",medium

I m nothing and I won t have anything enjoyable in my life Firstly I m sorry for my bad English but I m not a native speaker So I m years old boy and I ve been planning to commit suicide for couple of months I would probably do it already if not the fact that I doesn t want to hurt my mother and my friend Maybe you re wondering why such a young lad like me is willing to do that Well I would rather ask Why shouldn t I There is no happiness for me now or in the future I think every person consciously or unconsciously is seeking for happiness so what s the point of living where there is no hope for me to be a happy man I don t know if happiness isn t destined for me or I just not capable enough to reach it but does it really matter There s is not a good thing waiting for me period Everyone perceive happiness as a different thing For me happiness comes from social interactions and from making different people happy It may sound a little bit ironic considering the fact that I have to cope with terrible anxiety general akwardness and introversion Maybe that s the reason why I want to commit suicide happiness for me comes from a thing that I m not able to do I was thinking about becoming an writer That s a way right People will enjoy my books and everything will be fine Well there s the problem I m not good enough to make it work Although I enjoy writing what s the fucking point if it doesn t reach wider public Secondly I know it my sound kind of cheesy but I don t think I can reach happiness without having a girlfriend And for me having someone like that is not almost impossible it is just impossible There are various reasons for that I m ugly and overweight I m shy and introvertic I m bad at having conversations I m kind of a weirdo I don t like generic music and stuff etc It is so painful for me that no women will ever love me it s so fucking painful man And it s really not about sex I don t give a fuck about sex I can quickly jerk off and all of my lust is gone It s about love and everything that comes with that For the end I m just gonna say wish me that someday I will gain enough braveness to finally jump off the bridge,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk",high

am I the cause of my own demise Never posted on here before and I m not sure why I feel the urge to now I used to cut myself all the time in my head I did it for attention I wanted people to notice and ask me if I was okay so I could say that I wasn t and they safely tuck me away in a hospital for crazies and the doctors would spend months trying unsuccessfully to break through my emptiness The reality was that I was so scared of people seeing my cuts that I hid them the best I could despite having hundreds at any one time my family had no idea until I flipped out at school I was sitting in some stupid class I think we had a relief teacher it was a class where you could sit and talk with your friends and do nothing and the teacher wandered around doing sweet fuck all I don t know why but I grabbed a Stanley knife and sliced into my arm multiple times I remember it stinging so bad because there were so many lighter cuts underneath them I laughed I felt like I had something to prove A boy saw the blood and told the teacher she came over and I said he was lying but she wouldn t leave me alone so I pulled up my jumper sleeve and screamed at her to fuck off as I ran out I don t remember what happened next but my parents were told about it and I d left the school grounds The school councillor found me and for some reason I agreed to go with him to hospital He took me to be evaluated by a child shrink I barely said a word and I didn t look at him once I felt like I was in a trance the air around me felt so cold and heavy It was decided that I was perfectly sane and didn t need any sort of help what so ever The councillor took me home and my parents asked to see my cuts before never mentioning it ever again So anyway I continued to lead a destructive lifestyle most weekends were spent wiping myself out with a bottle of straight bourbon or vodka I hung out at local music gigs with my friends many of them much much older than myself I did things to the extreme because it made me popular not always in a good way I went out of my way to stand up for my behaviour so if someone in our extended friends circle thought I was a dick I d push and push until their close friends liked me and they d eventually give in and treat me nicely too Meanwhile I was a straight A student my parents worked a lot they didn t pay much attention to my schooling my grades weren t bad so they didn t give it a second thought In fact they saw me as being responsible I often babysat my little sisters one of them from when she was only a few months old I wouldn t abandon them or throw parties or anything but I did play horrible mind games with them and they d never tell because I d scared them into believing that was worse than whatever I d tricked them into thinking had happened was happening All of this stuff it was selfish I wanted to be the rebellious renegade cool kid but my parents and to a point my teachers were fed this bullshit goody two shoes image that they fell for This is how I got away with never doing my hometown handing in essays late wearing incorrect uniform everyday never doing exams never paying attention spending most of my time in the classroom yelling and laughing and making excuses Looking back I can honestly say that I am amazed at how much shit I got away with and that I finished school I found comfort in typing to a select few male friends for hours upon hours I often developed crushes on them but they never went much further than sex i was young and they were often in their early s One guy in particular sticks in my head not sexually or anything we never even went there back then in fact he broke his hand after punching a tree at his birthday party because he felt so bad that I was so attached to him at the time So that was my first real broken heart our friendship was awkward for a while and then I moved away and we have barely spoke since As a teenager I threw massive tantrums but I didnt realise the extent of them until the last few years when I discovered that I have black outs where I am in an uncontrollable rage I remember my parents holding me down at to check for track marks on my arms I must have been pretty psychotic for them to accuse me of being a junkie Teen angst I assumed but years on my episodes have only gotten worse This is already a stupidly long story I don t even tell this to my shrink so I ll summarise the rest quickly my family moved several hours away when I was in my second last year of school I hated my new school I felt so stupid and lost and uncomfortable I got pregnant had a secret abortion and never forgave myself I moved back and lived in a granny flat with one of my sisters Finished school but things just went ever the same I d discovered drugs Pills and speed My school friends didn t understand I moved back to the city near my parents The guy I got pregnant to had hung around and I was living with him until I realised I had only stayed with him because I was a mess after the baby thing he got abusive when I left him not wanting my parents to judge me or seem weak I kept living with my ex filing in my weekends with raves and a rebound guy One thing that did impact my life at this point was ghb considered a dirty scum drug I had a big crazy image to build to ensure I was popular in this new scene it was easy I had nothing to live for I hated myself for what I d done and the more I partied the less I had to stop and deal with the consequences I ended up in an ambulance times in weeks I passed out and woke up in some random guys bed with him fucking me I ran away and went back to the club I met a guy that loved going out too but knew I needed help so he wouldn t let me out of the house no matter how much I kicked and screamed We went out for a year but we were bad for each other we substituted ghb with speed and were still taking ghb when we could I spent destructive months after he left me in pieces My friends saw the tantrums one night male friends tried to stop me from hurting myself but I am stupidly strong in these rages and I managed to smash my head into the concrete several times until they let me go and then I ran and ran and don t remember the rest Ghb was ruining me again I met a guy from the rave scene I didn t think I was ready to leave my ex in the past but I decided to give it a chance So glad I did best thing that ever happened to me We moved in together after only a few weeks and years on were engaged I don t want to disclose the finger details in this time but I will say that whilst I m a better person we still give in to temptations just as often and I still have anger issues but until recently I hadn t wanted to hurt myself like I do right now My sister died a short time ago Overdose But on opiates It s not real to me it confuses me I can t make sense of it I don t want to deal with it I was diagnosed with ADHD anxiety disorders including mild OCD about a year ago Since my sister died my OCD is my way of coping things that used to be funny but necessary to me now physically hurt if I don t do them or if I do them wrong I can t help but think that my childhood desire to have people feel sorry for me paved the way to becoming that person Sometimes I wonder if it s just all in my head if I don t completely believe that I m sick how will I ever help myself When I get angry I often black out my partner tells me what happened each time I ve tried to jump out of his car at high speeds on a freeway drank bleach tried to grab a gun off a police officer hit my head so many times it s not funny taken pills blah blah right now it all seems like a good idea I feel so selfish It makes me feel worse,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update",high

I am a make and I am 16 and I just broke up with my gf. When I was little I was touched by a girl in my school and she kept doing it even after I said no. Although I told my close friends what happened they told me I was a loser and that I should have liked it. Sometimes when I go to sleep at night I can still hear there voices telling me I am a loser and my recent relationship did not help. During the relationship I felt like I was more of a therapist than I was her boyfriend and she dumped all of her problems and issues on to me and expected me to be able to make her feel better every time. This made me feel horrible about myself because anytime I did not make her feel better we would have an argument and then he would say she was wrong and apologize. We have had more than 60 arguments over our 6 month relationship. And anytime I would ask my friends if I should break up with her they would say no. But during my last two weeks of school my parents told me I could not call anyone or play games so my grades would stay up. The same friends that told me not to break up with her told her to break up with me for not talking to her. I broke up with her because she wants me to give her 6 hours a day and anytime I ask for time to myself she would see upset. I hate myself right now and I do not know why. I have cut myself multiple times and have to pretend like everything is ok when in reality I am 5 seconds away from breaking down. I do not want to seem emotional because I feel like my friends are just going to tell me I am overreacting and it is not as bad as I am making it. I am scared to tell my parents because I feel like they will see me differently. If anyone could give me some help I would love it or at least some advice on what to do I would love it.

"I have so many stressors in my life, all major things that tear me down. Every day I fight a battle not just with my mental health but with the world. Last night I finally broke. After 33 years of a shit show of a life, I am done. What ultimately triggered this is that my son (7m) with ADHD has been expelled from holiday club. I quit my job Jan 2020 because he was not coping in school and managed to find him a specialist educational provider as well as get him on medication. He did brilliantly! I however, hated being a SAHM and a carer. The loneliness is overwhelming and the fact that I only live to provide food and a clean house to 3 children. So, I started to think about going back to work in my area of specialty which is law. I got a job with a police department. Something for me and something where I will meet other adults without being attached to my children. I got all 3 of my children into a childcare provider and settled them in over months. I have officially been working for less than 2 weeks and my son has regressed back to his bad behaviour. He has been kicked out and now I have to quit my job and go back to being his full time carer. I cannot do this for the next 11 years of his life and possibly beyond that. I do not want to live anymore and there is no help out there for my situation. I can go back on antidepressants, I can go to therapy but none of these things fix my problem that I no longer have any autonomy over my life. I am not a person any more, I am merely a mum with no identity other than that of my children. I find no pleasure in anything and exhaust myself pretending to be happy for the sake of my family. I cannot work, and now as it turns out I cannot even die. I cannot leave behind my children, I am their only parent. I have no control in this life over anything. I now think I am too far gone to ever feel happy again. I want to die. I cannot go back to Groundhog Day",Critical Risk,high

Trying to stay strong but don t know what my options are and I don t want to throw my life away I ve had a long history with depression and anxiety and usually I m able to push through until things stabilize again and enjoy life until the next wave hits Another wave hit a few weeks ago and this one hit hard Hard enough that it was the first time I ve taken action and woke up next to a a spilt bottle of pills and vodka and dry heaved for about an hour before calling into work sick the next two days This scared the shit out of me Scared me enough that I haven t touched alcohol in the past two weeks But I still feel just as bad as I did that day and I don t want whatever snapped inside of me that night to happen again About six months ago I started a new job I knew it would be a challenge but it was an opportunity I couldn t turn down Lately I can barely make myself show up to even fill the spot at the desk You know when you just made a huge mistake and feel your stomach tighten up That s how I feel all the time My depression is affecting my performance which makes me feel even worse and I know people are noticing I want to do better but I just can t right now and I m afraid they ll either find someone that can do better or I ll drive myself to snap again I don t want to feel like a failure and certainly not because of my stupid brain But I don t know what my options are If I keep grinding I m afraid I ll snap again soon If I leave I ll ruin this opportunity and possible future ones because I m leaving after only months for unclear reasons I don t want to throw my career away but I never want to end up where I was a couple of weeks ago again either And I don t know how to do both right now,"Cause of Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Mental Distress",medium

I feel rejected by the system and I don t know where else to turnI don t really know where to start because I feel like I ve been on this roundabout for a little while now I dealt with a fair bit of bullying and family issues divorce DV as a child young teen This made me feel quite anxious for a few years and this is where I first started with psychology It really helped me for a while but the anxiety slowly faded away and was replaced by depression I d say for about three years now I ve been really depressed It s hard to tell because you don t really know how bad it is until you re through it I guess has been horrible for me It s been difficult to do anything so my grades have slipped really badly I ve tried to kill myself four times this year all with some form of drug and alcohol It s usually messy but I guess when you re that impaired that you don t have a filter it gets a lot messier when you say things you regret to family and friends I deserve it but now most of my family and friends have desserted me too I don t blame them because honestly I ve been horrible The last time I tried was about three months ago now It was at my university campus and there were posts to the facebook student group while I was in my impaired state I didn t intend on doing that nor do I know why I did The result was that I was found after a goose chase with security and was arrested and taken to hospital Of course it was just like the other times I was drunk so they assume I wasn t really depressed and that I was horrible for doing what I did I was placed in a room and I wasn t allowed to see anyone or have my phone I had to beg a doctor for help and that was when I finally got some antidepressants I d been on them before but it was too expensive to keep seeing my psychiatrist I was finally released and it turns out I sent some pretty embarrassing and inappropriate emails to one of my favourite lecturers who I really looked up to That really made me upset by putting someone in that position I ve apologised and since haven t got a response even though I know he shouldn t have to it s a professional setting you know even though he said he s always there to talk if I need it It really hurts because even though he was purely a teacher he was one of the few people that I really trusted and I felt was there for me Depression makes you get attached to people I guess The posts were visible to everybody so whenever I step on campus I get a lot of bullying about it now too So I m too scared to go back I know my mum has had it to because last time we fought she said she was too tired of worrying about me and that I should just do it because she needs closure I know she didn t mean it but it really hurts But the worst part is the hospitals I m always treated like a criminal I m always hated by the nurses and doctors And I stress so much about previous experiences there that I can hardly bring myself to go to a doctor or talk to a counsellor just in case I say something too worrying I feel completely rejected by the medical people that are there to help as well as everybody who has said they care I ve been on these new medication for about three months now I feel less depressed I can get up in the morning and stuff like that But the suicidal urges are still here They re so strong I have to self harm just to get rid of them I m so worried about it And the worst part is that I know if I do it again I m going to make sure that I succeed because I can t deal with the hospital again I m worried that I m going to hurt myself I don t want to but I don t see any other option at this point Please help me,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update, Seeking Help",high

took half a bar of xan i was hella loopy and shit and got really depressed the night before i made a pretty bad cut and i wanted to go deeper i stumbled for my box cutter and cut i reached fat i was bleeding a lot but i wasn t panicking i put gauze and wrapped it up rly tight i called my friend for around minutes and all i remember was saying i m gonna die over and over again i vividly remember his disappointed yet calm voice saying you re not going to die idk how but i hung up i don t remember much after but i know i took the other half and blacked out with no other memory of what happened i have videos of me on snap talking to myself saying shit like i don t have any real friends when i woke up my head was killing me and my cut was still bleeding w yellow shit coming out of it too i was really worried of infection the night before my dad saw my cut and just put triple anti biotic and medical tape on it so that s what i did for days i told some online friends and they were really worried especially my boyfriend they all were telling me to go to my parents and get stitches but i didn t have enough strength to the first day the days passed and i was getting worried yellow shit was still coming out of it and i got paranoid it was infected so i told my older sister who s she was really worried when she saw it and she made jokes about it that kind of made me feel better but hurt sometimes she decided the best thing was to get my parents i was panicking and didn t want to do i got her to get them downstairs they asked if i did it to myself i said yes they began yelling at me fueled with anger my dad was squeezing my arm and touching my cuts that hurt like hell my mom was the most angry i held back tears but their yelling is what made me cry she was cursing at me making me feel like shit for waking them up it s all a blur really but i remember saying i just feel like a burden my mom laughed and said i was being dramatic and kept saying omg that s how i felt though like a weight being dragged around constantly needing help that i don t ask for my mom made me sleep in her room my dad on the couch like always i begged to just sleep on the couch or in my sisters room but she just said no which i understand i couldn t sleep that night her room even in our old house makes me uneasy i m wide awake my insomnia didn t help either my dad took my phone i was grounded from seeing my friends my room etc i just wanted a hug support from them but what did i expect my parents have always been abusive idk why i didn t guess they d make me feel even shittier to

diagnosed with depression anxiety ocd add an insomnia i withdrawal from my meds and drugs like weed and xan the next morning i woke up early like early i spent the day watching the office i just wanted to laugh my mom of course got angry but didn t do much about it i changed my bandaids on my own my parents didn t bother with it too much even though it was at an extreme risk of infection i asked friends and strangers if it looked infected and read how to keep it clean there was still puss coming out which wasn t normal i asked my mom but she blew it off i didn t know what to do but keep cleaning it i slept in my sisters room that night the next day my day had bought spray on liquid bandage that i ve never heard of i found out later it should be used for minor cuts he sprayed it inside of the cut i have a high pain tolerance but i almost cried he kept pinching my cuts i told him i could do it but he kept denying it i put on more medical tape and it hurt all day i regret telling them so much my friend recommended calling suicide hotline to get cps involved but i couldn t do that to my younger sister so i never did ive been feeling pretty empty even right now my cuts have healed pretty well but my mind has blocked out a lot of the memory of what happened my friend the one i called the night of told me yesterday you know you said something the night u made that cut that really stuck with me you said you weren t even scared or anxious you just did it cause it felt so good is that true i was shocked at that i didn t know what to say i knew it was true but i didn t

 TLDR at bottom with quotes from article.
 
 —-
 
 I can’t sleep, so I’ve been laying in bed contemplating my mental health and doing cell phone research. Anyway, came across this article that was REALLY interesting to me.
 
 I’ve never been tested for autism, but I’ve suspected most my life, never tested because parents didn’t see it and was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, then several years later the diagnosis was corrected to bpd, and I just put it off as okay bpd has similar things that’s all it is.
 
 However, my wife and I both have bpd and we’ve been comparing thought processes and talking about mental health a lot lately. And while we’re similar, we differ in a lot of ways. There’s a huge part of my behavior she still can’t understand when it comes to understanding what’s appropriate in certain interactions or in the often completely different ways I interpret situations. It brought me back to thinking maybe it is something more than JUST bpd, so yeah… the googling.
 
 I put the article at the top and I’ll put it [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5590952/#!po=1.02041) as well.
 
 
 Basically I’m not crazy… 
 
 TLDR: I’ll sum it up with some quotes from the study:
 
 “…some females with BPD have undiagnosed ASC, due to ASC not being easily detected in females.”
 
 “Recent research is focusing on the possible under-diagnosis or mis-diagnosis of ASC in females [40,41], on the assumption that females may experience greater societal pressure to conform and be part of a peer group and so are more motivated to learn how to hide their autism (so-called “camouflaging”) and thereby go “under the radar” of clinicians or school psychologists, by “pretending to be normal” [42]. This may lead to them either receiving their ASC diagnosis far later than males, and/or being diagnosed with other conditions (anorexia, depression, anxiety, or BPD) because clinicians are not looking for how ASC may present itself differently in females.”
 
 “…found that 6 out of 41 BPD patients fulfilled criteria for ASC.”
 
 “Our findings highlight the need for careful examination for autistic traits in patients referred for an assessment for BPD, especially in those without a history of significant childhood abuse or neglect. Some of these patients may have been misdiagnosed (their ASC was overlooked), and a proportion of them may have both conditions.”
 
 
 To put it short….
 
 Def going to talk to my psych MD about if I can be tested for autism now. Holy crap this article made every thing about me make so much more sense! Now I’m wide awake too! I mean, last thing I need is ANOTHER diagnosis to add to the pile, but if it helps it helps! So much for research articles putting people to sleep.""",Positive Coping,low

So objectively the best decision I could make is to end my own life what I m deep in student loan debt unemployed and no job prospects are opening up any time soon HOWEVER My student loans are forgiven in the event of my death So at best right now I could hope to break even by offing myself how does this make sense I ll admit I ve had a few too many to drink tonight but I ve got a loaded gun sitting within arms reach and I could totally do it no problem My goal in life is to help people that s why I spent so much fucking money on my education but looking at things the way they are now I think the best option for my future is to just call it quits Someone talk to me,"Cause of Distress, Maladaptive Coping",medium

Dear HumanityIt s funny how life works it really is the roll of the dice Some people live brilliant successful lives by climbing their way to the top Some people live lives of heartache and pain they then turn that into an art and become successful too Some people are just ordinary and blessed with a family or maybe just a single parent and they thrive and overcome the odds Some people are born with terminal illness mental illness disabilities and whatever else and they all succeed Then you got people like me people who tried everything they could and fought their way with everything they had only to not be enough Now here I am on this random reddit page venting this all out because I see no outcome other than death after this Treat people well treat people with respect treat those who are unfortunate and encourage them with love Give them a boost anyway you can and just realize that we all are just one single species at the end of the day The planet doesn t belong to us we belong to the planet If you have a significant other out your arm around them and say how much you love them because you never know what tomorrow will bring Make your significant other some food breakfast lunch and or dinner whatever you feel like you can do buy them flowers take them on dates make them smile and laugh help them feel motivated like they can do anything Most of all let them know you will always be there I was once so ignorant and arrogant that I thought I could help everyone Because I hate it when people are hurt and I tried to make it my number one priority to help others in anyway that I could because I thought we needed more love in this world I took on a responsibility that was impossible and I should have seen it coming but alas I allowed my own ignorance and arrogance to blind me That is my own fault and I take ownership for such foolishness Now here I am recovering from a botched surgery that should have killed me and to be frank I wish it did When I finally got better and tried to start again with my monthly disability natural disasters struck my hometown leaving many out of a home car everything While I was lucky in that regard the day after the disasters happened my car was stolen probably by someone who was desperate So here it is me years old tried to make something happen in my life now it has all failed Therefore I am officially a failure and I want this life to end I am now just figuring out a way how I wish you all well and just do your best in a world filled with hate hostility lies deceit and cruelty,"Cause of Distress, Positive Coping",medium

"I was diagnosed with depression when I was 13, it was from a school councillor. Later things were being a lil simple but then I lost my best friend. So it’s weird, she left me and my coping mechanism was to assume that she died. I feel it’s real. I’ve severe anxiety, like all physical symptoms. I’ve them all, just that I don’t sweat. Anxiety attacks, panic attacks are a normal part of my life since past two years.
 I’ve lost so many people now that I’m not weak but broken now. All were family (no breakup).
 I’m afraid I’ve BPD, I’ve all 8/9 symptoms. I don’t wanna self diagnos but I feel it’s real.
 I feel everything just so intense that can’t even discribe.
 Sometimes I feel I’m making mental illness, I’m fake is all I feel when no symptoms around.
 I’ve chest pain almost all day in breaks, sometimes mild, sometimes strong. It’s just so pathetic. I feel as a complete fake and unknown person. Can’t recognise what are my choices and who am I?
 Can someone tell me do I’ve BPD or am I faking?
 Anxiety and Depression are real but sometimes I think that’s also fake.
 Can’t go for professional help as I’m 17 rn and there are things so, I’ll go for professional help when I’ll be 18 and get a college admission.
 Please helps people.
 I’ve told about ya symptoms to many people but half them mocked me and made fun and others just showed sympathy which I hated. I feel also, just so alone.

life just seems pointless im senior year i guess i ll start out with how i got to this point i started to feel down th grade around the time my grandpa was in the hospital which i wasn t close to he would come in and out of the hospital and i guess seeing him that way just hurt i dont even know why i felt that way when those words that he said when i was in th grade still lingered i still enjoyed doing simple things and still wanted to try out new things i bought a ukulele got in to drawing and tried making friends i actually met one of my ex best friend she will be coming up at the end it wasn t bad at all but i felt this nagging feeling above my head that i was able to ignore cut to th grade oh boy was that year fun thats when i started questioning why i was still even here breathing i started high school and most of my classes were filled with people from others schools which already had their own friends of groups compared to how i was in middle school i started to become real quiet my middle school wasn t that big and everyone pretty much knew everyone so it was easy for me to conversate with others at the end of th grade i also realized that i was starting to develop anxiety i would shake and my body temperature would go up amp was on the verge of passing out anyways as you can tell trying to talk to others was quite intimidating i started to feel alone and just isolated from everyone in my classes not only that i was in advanced classes and felt so stupid in all of them i couldn t even reach their level of intelligence i was dumb compared to all of them i no longer wanted to participate i would hate when teachers called on me it was the worst feeling ever oh i forgot to mention my grandpa died a month later after my freshman year started i pick up others emotions so i was sad would cry over everything and just felt like complete shit i had about friends at the time which i guess you could say i no longer am friends with them anyways school work started to pile up i started getting stressed about it and would even cry at times because i couldnt understand some of the stuff i started to develop some thoughts that weren t healthy in my head i would tell myself im stupid worthless all the teachers saw me as some excuse o a student and so on i started to just lock myself in my room and sleep i developed an eating disorder which i thought was normal at the time because teenagers right i wouldn t shower for days yet my anxiety kept me worried about how i looked imagine caring about what others think of you while you don t even care about yourself its a fucking pain in the ass i gained a friend that year but eventually cut ties with her during the summer th grade came along i continued to take advanced classes just to make my parents proud i wanted them to be proud of me and tell me that just one time turns out i just disappointed them more this is when i started to skip days at school telling my mom i felt sick and so once i even faked i was sick but it turned out i had strep throat kinda funny tbh ayways my grades started to go down i was usually and A or A B type of girl but my grades started going towards C s and at times D s I met this guy as well that i started to develop feelings for this was the first time i actually wanted to step out of my comfort zone and get to know them i still dont know till this day if it was a good or bad idea i honestly don t remember much about th grade year it seems a little fuzzy all i know is that my depression and anxiety got worse i was thinking about suicide more often and even thought of ways to do it just a reminder my parents and siblings had no idea that i was feeling down i would always act hyper and made jokes just to make them laugh i fake laughed and tried not to get them worried th grade i had only like adv class and an AP class to get myself to take a break i told myself at the end of th grade that i would get my shit together and even managed to get decent grades on the st weeks of school i started to have trouble sleeping my thoughts started to get more vivid and had nightmares i also almost passed out while talking in a group discussion because i was so anxious i dont know how many times i started to write suicide letters i would have breakdown every other month thst led me to just wanting to end it all this took place so last yeart then started everything started to go to shit the guy i mentioned earlier yeah i admitted my feelings towards him and he then started to talk to me less eventually we stopped talking completely mostly it being my fault i also lost my bestfriend i dont know what happened or what i did but we just stopped talking it hurt a lot it really fucking hurt i went days without eating and lost almost pounds i was pounds foot inchs so i finally became underweight that was the only thing i had under control my weight i felt at ease i liked seeing my ribs popping out i liked the way i looked for the first time even now i wish i would stop eating so much this was around the time finally talked to the counselor and my mom and sister came up and talked to them about how i was feeling when we walked out of school my sister just told me you should ve judt killed yourself in there i got a therapist around march i started taking medication went from lexapro prozac some sleeping pills and some other stuff i cant remember lexapro left me feeling numb i couldn t cry i couldn t feel a thing i remember explaining to my friend the feeling its as if you are trapped in the glass box and no matter how many times you try to break it and get out of there it didn t work you just yelled at no one when me and my bestfriend defriended i got a new friend i wasn t at the best state physically and mentally i wouldn t shower for a week i was just bone i would skip a lot of class oh yeah did i mention that i started skipping almost everyday i remember thinking whats wrong with me i wasn t like this how would i let myself get to this point i was someone that cared a out school even if it was challenging i wasn t one to get down over small or big things i wouldn t get hurt over one small comment almost at the end of march i first tried attempting with the lexapro i only took but i called my friends and they picked me up i spent time with them for a little while i stopped myself before i took more so im not sure if its really an attempt i didn t mention this to my therapist because you know i d get sent to the hospital weeks later i attempted again this time i took some pain killers it was at the time they were like mg per pill I just felt a little sick from the stomach but that was all I called my friend again and told her what was going on of them came over and talked to me my friend asked me if i wanted to tell my mom in which i did we ended up crying a lot she kept asking me why do i want to die why am i feeling like this why dont i see value in life do you know how shitty i felt i the person that lives in this body doesn t even know the cause my friends had called out but i started to act hyper i always do this to make others think i am doing well now they ordered pizza and we ate they both worked at the same place so they called the manager and told them that they could actually go in my heart broke a little that day i always wished someone would stay with me even when i told them the opposite they just left they believed i was doing well i ended up telling my therapist what i did a week later since thats when i was scheduled to go she ended up sending me to the hospital and told my mom that its best to do so or i ll end up succeeding although it was nice for me to not worry about anything anymore i didnt like it i wasn t with the people that i cared about all i needed was to be with the ones that cared and loved me even if they were acting as if they did thats all i needed i pushed them away so many times and i know its my fault i know i am the one to blame but i still felt even more depressed because i wanted them to tell me no i am not leaving i wanted them to just lay with me and hug me and just tell me everything was going to be okay even if i didnt believe that thats all i ever wanted june came along so school ended i tried again i tried overdosing on sleeping pills i took about this time even till this day i still have no clue what i meant to text one of my friends ah i forgot to mention the friend i gained after i lost my best friend dated my brother i started to like her a little after they broke up and she even admitted that she was kind of gaining interest on me while dating my brother i was so confused during this time though because she never told me straight forward if she liked me or not i wasn t in the best state of mind obviously so all that made sense to me was that she hated me she never liked me and just used me to gain information about my brother i had also stopped talking to my other friends and even stopped telling one of them the same one that works with her about what i was thinking because the first thing she would do is tell her anyways im pretty sure it caught her by surprise that i texted her that day and it not making any sense all i remember was going unconscious and then waking up several times i would try to plug in my phone to charge and i thought i would and would pass out and then wake up to do the same thing standing up was hard i almost fell because of how heavy my body felt thankfully i didn t throw up i hate throwing up cue to the next day i had my therapy appointment im surprised my therapist didn t ask if i was okay i was shaking a lot and couldn t focus i was still out of it and had the same feeling i had the day before but without feeling my body heavy passing out randomly and so i even drove that day which i know i shouldn t have but i wasn t thinking I can t even remember much of that day I do remember around pm though I started to text my friends I cant remember what i said or what they said i do remember getting angry and i started to get aggresive the last thing i told the friend that i liked at the time no wonder that my brother left you before that i do remember her saying that you can t help someone that doesn t want help thats all i can remember that just hit me for some reason all those months that i tried getting help seemed like nothing to her i was so fucking upset this was the same person that dealt with suicidal thoughts and depression someone that even attempted thats why it hurt so much i was trying so hard to get help even if it was hard for me to open up i was never taught to talk about my feelings so the fact that i told an adult meant that i seriously was in need of help i ended up blocking everyone and i cried so much i cried a lot it hurt it still hurts she even told me she thought of telling me that i should ve killed myself now i wish that she did say those words then i would have an actual reason i texted them the next day and told them i was sorry they forgave me which they shouldn t have maybe it was better and if we just left it like it was i still hate myself for saying those words till this day i haven t been the same ever since nothing feels real cut to th grade which is now i was planning on doing it on my birthday i wrote a note each day leading to it and i decided to do it days earlier i was supposed to start my first day at my job i called out and told my mom i was working i went to the park i was planning on slitting my wrist turned out the blade amp pocket knife didn t work so well on my wrist and barely did anything i didn t tell my friends about it and decided to just wait till my actual birthday thinking it was just the day you know my birthday came up and i was waiting for my friends to say happy birthday they didn t i posted on my story crying i wrote on the last note they forgot about my birthday the day i hated the most my birthday made me hate it even more i wasn t worthy of their time they saw my stort and felt bad and texted me they came to my house and gave me last minute gifts they felt forced i doubt they even wanted to be there cue to now i finally pushed them off for good i told them what i was planning and told them how i was feeling they ended up writing a letter to my mom like days ago and left it in the mail i was the one that went to get the mail that day i read it and i got really upset angry sad the people that i thought knew me the most wanted to send me to the hospital all i wanted was for them to stay with me not send me somewhere in which i feel trapped somewhere where they are not i got angry and texted them were involved in this one wasnt i texted on the gc where all were one the one that wasnt a part of it got upset over what i said the others didnt say anything until i said if that was all they got i started saying to tell me how they really feel about me because i knoe they are holding themselves back just because they are afraid i ll break i blocked all of them after that and now i have no reason for no longer to stay here even one of the people which were feeling suicidal a while back wated to send me to the hospital when i didn t even think about sending them there because i know it wasn t what they needed or wanted they needed to be with people that loved them and made sure they were safe i didnt get out of her car that day and told her i wasn t leaving she gave in and slept in my room why couldn t they do the same for me am i not worthy of having someone do that for me its kind of funny i was in my car the other day in the same spot we were in when we skipped school one day at that time i thought i was really alone but now now i ve actuall reached that i am alone now i have no

I feel empty I ve got nothing leftI ve been suffering from depression for a couple of months now It sort of came out of nowhere It made no sense at the time because everything in my life was wonderful and happy and I had no reason to be so miserable Slowly it began destroying everything I tried an SSRI but it made things significantly worse Throughout it all my boyfriend supported me It was so hard for us and it challenged us so much but he stuck by me I told him everything and he supported us throughout Yesterday after what had been a brilliant couple of days he broke up with me We always kept having silly little arguments I know they were triggered by how stressful everything had been because of me but for the most part we had been having such good times and being so good to each other I tried to get him to stay but he wouldn t he d made up his mind I waited until I was in a more sane mood and sent him a long email telling him everything that I felt I know he read it but he hasn t replied I won t send him another I know I shouldn t have done that in the first place I ve tried everything I can think of I ve got anxieties out of nowhere All I can think about is the fact that I need him and that I m nothing without him I spent years in university to qualify for a job that I hate This morning I got an email from a new course that I wanted to start telling me my qualifications were enough that I could do a conversion course Only I can t because since then I got diagnosed with severe depression and it s one of those careers where a history of depression is enough that you re unable to do it And I just want to tell my ex about this and share with him but I can t I know I can t contact him again I ve tried everything I can think of but I can t pull myself out of this I have the stupid irrational sadness from depression and now the logical sadness from this It s all building up so much He was never completely my life I still had friends I ve texted fifteen people One has agreed to meet over the weekend The others are all busy with their own things It s fair enough I ve tried getting out and doing things but it s just no hope I m not improving I m getting worse I no longer know what to do I can t keep going like this,"Cause of Distress, Mental Distress, Mood Tracking, Positive Coping, Progress Update",medium

I can t take this no more the agony is killing me LONG STORY SHORT So my name is Alfred Florin and I have been suffering from ocd pure o since I was I am now From a very young age I shook hands with Ocd and had anxiety problems but they were not a big deal it was present or days then it would go away without a huge effort When I was the sickness struck hard and I felt its presence so hard like it was a possession I will get there too but now let s continue the story My first ocd encounter was when I have stepped on a guy s foot when I was I guess You may be wondering what s wrong with that or what that means Well in Romania there is a urban myth it goes like this if you step on someone s foot and that person doesn t step on your back your mother dies Well there were many people around me cause it was the mayor elecrion that day and after I have stepped on that guy s foot I couldn t figure where he went cause it happened fast and then he disappeared in the crowd in an instant Well when I got home I thought at the fact that my mom could be dead cause I have stepped on that guy s foot I wasn t really scared or anything just a little worried I know it s stupid even for a year old but yeah Well I guess hours passed and I started thinking in that obsessive way that my mom will die and etc bad thoughts my chest started burning and everything I would say to fight it back I couldn t get me to believe that it s not real I have started crying and the pain made me feel like my life was ruined Well it passed really soon I guess the next day I was kind of ok I DID NOT TELL ANYONE ABOUT IT After that experience till age I had various exeperiences like that one but it did not bother me on the long run Let me give some examples I was thinking at biomechanics and had some repetitive body movements I couldn t stop from doing them until I felt like I had hit the right spot or the movement was the right one I once sae a really f cked up thing on a website it was a soup made of a fetus Well after I saw that my mind started telling me that I would enjoy it and would like to eat it And I couldn t stop from imagining myself from eating it even though I hated these images it was pure hell cause I was a religious person and that made me feel like I had let God down Whenever I would go to church I would imagine Jesus and Mary having sex and I just couldn t stop thinking and I would get images and mind movies and I would just leave church feeling like CRAP It made me feel like I was such a bad person and I was actually crippled by these thoughts but it went off really fast and it did not affect my life on the long run I repeat I had periods when I would feel bad and depressed and felt a ache in my chest and it was just like my soul hurt not my chest I was really emotional all of a sudden I would get scared easily and cry really fast Let me talk to you abot age I had a friend at that did not believe in Jesus and we would argue all day long about religous stuff and I was explaining to him thing every single day about hours a day every damn day and that caused me a lot of stress but I really wanted to help him and I felt like it was my duty to stop his tears with the help of God Well one day I was sitting at my computer and one of his questions about god popped into my head I have tried to answer it myself but I couldn t get the answer right so I have seesrched it on google saw different responses but guess what not a single answer made me feel ok I felt a thirst of truth and the next minutes my chest lighted up little by little and the pain was getting stronger I was searching and searching for an answer and guess what That question transformed into questions per second In my mind I felt a tornado of questions making my soul and my brain hurt like no other thing in this world That day I have spent it wandering the streets cause I just couldn t sit still My chest and soul were on fire and my mind was full of questions I was walking like a mad man and looking straight into nothingness while while walking and trying to give myself a answer to all of the questions while slowly strating to realize that I was going to hell cause I started doubting God and its works and that made my chest EXPLODE and I have bursted into tears and the biggest and badeest panick attack I have ever experienced and the first My mom came home from work and I was keep telling her that my soul aches and I do not know what to do she was distressed by my situation but she was thinking that it s only a teenage thing and it will pass Nightime came and the pain and question were just king of gone but they were omnipresent Before bed I was a disaster I got down on my knees and prayed like tomorrow was the end of days but the next day the same thing happened It got to the point that I had to sleep with my mom and listen to the radio all night long and all day long just not to hear BRAIN THAT WAS TELLING ME THAT I WAS GOING TO HELL AND I HAD IMAGES OF ME BURNING IN HELL GLUED TO MY MIND AND SOUL Well It went like this for months until my father came home from abroad and went with me to a psychiatrist and thing went ok for a while but that psychiatrist did not care about me and it took years for me to understand that it was wrong seeing her She gave me the same pills all these years and we never did therapy but I had a fear of leaving the treatment behind and leaving my psychiatrist cause I thought no one would understand and I continued on for years the fifth year I was off pils off seeing a psychiatrist etc while I was seeing the psychiatrist everything was bad but it was bearable My life was shit but I could cope with it In these years i have been through all of the branches of OCD I had HOCD fobias Religious ocd blah blah I guess I had tasted all of it The Hocd wrecked my life but I went through it like a champ This last year the fifth I met Laura and my new ocd chapter began RETROACRIVE JEALOUSY IS MY PRIMARY ENEMY NOW It s not like I dont have the scars of my other ocd episodes I still was depreseed angry and full of pain when I met her but one thing I wasn t Hopeless I had a hope that I would get better I have met her march she was different she had sexual some really colorful sexual experiences and she seamed slutty She was talking to me about her sexual past and black men in her life and how she cheated on her ex cause she was horny and stuff We kissed one night and I saw something in her something special even if she talked like she did but I like her as a person she was funny and she had a nice personality We were toghether and one day I just couldn t stop thinking at these men she has been with and how she talked to me about them and my ocd started kicking after months in the reltionship my ocd came in and ruined us in a way I was unabe to please her sexualy unable to kiss her It got to the point where I wanted to break up because of it And i was at inch of doing it but we got through it and we were kind of ok not good but ok Well we were toghether i was getting ready for an exam in august when I found put that she cheated o me in june with her ex Alin several times in that month and they have been talking from some time I guess they started talking in april after I have found that in august I forgave her and was strict with her for a month so she would understand that she did wrong and it wrecked our relationship In that period an anger lighted up in me ai started talking to my ex too but nothing romantic or so just random talk I did not touch her or anything I have stopped talking to her at the middle of september cause I feel like that anger wasn t doing me any good and I need to forgive her Well everthing went really good until I found out that she has been in a club one night on the date of of september and she went with her best friend that recently got into a relationship guess with who the dude with she cheated on her ex Alin with he s called Paul she went to the club with Paul her best friend Andreea and Teodor a dude wich she has been seeing while she was in a relationship with her ex That night she got drunk she did drugs and she asked Teodor why did we stop seeing eachother and when he left she asked are you leaving my here with these crazies paul and andreea at the end of the night she was spitted on by a dude cause she intervened while he was shouting at Paul that he wants to fight him and Laura said fight me the he spitted her Teodor said Laura asked him to come back and take her back home to chill but she said that it is not true She lied to me about many things and I don t know what to believe I forgave her but after that night My ocd started wrecking my life again After I found this I contacted my ex and slept with her put of anger I did it with her twice and I regret it because I did not feel anything for her Laura found and she got over it Problem is we are ok with a new start though I don t trust her like some time ago and I can t stop asking her questions and details about her past and she cheating me how she did it why minor details anything I get an answer i feel better for an hour then it kicks again and I can t stop getting mental movies and images and hearing things about her and other man ablut her and Teodor Alin Paul and etc I really need to get back on track but it seems really hard I have told her that in order for this to work she need to stop talking to other men going to club stol doing this stop doing that etc is it right What am I doing I will go to a specialist who really cares but until then Please help me every word matters please tell me if my relationship is worth anything Would you forgive what would you do I just cant stop getting images and my brain tells me that she betrayed me twice not just once with Alin but twice with that night in the club and that I am not good enough and my self esteem is wrecked I can t even go for a walk cause everytime I do I see someone more muscular or more attractive than me in any way my ocd teels me that my girlfriend will like him cause he is better or that she look at him and admires him ai get really jealous and I lock myself into a shell Sometimes I feel like I am just like a little a wounded boy who just wants to be understood and loved and its hard because we live in a really plastic and harsh world Nobody cares

Oh where to begin I ve been plagued by mental health issues pretty much since birth This caused an enormous amount of strain on me and my family and made me an outcast from early childhood and gained a reputation of weird out there bad ect from people who knew absolutely nothing about me But I just shrugged it off and kept on going Then in middle school I started getting bullied couldn t walk down the hallway without getting called a faggot and it being middle school the rumors about me just flew like crazy Then I was homeschooled in th grade because of the bullying and the rumors took on a whole new level of crazy and just flat out bullshit But I just kept going And then in th grade I went back to school and finally made friends People still had all kinds of bullshit ideas about me without ever even having a conversation about me But I actually made friends Then in high school everything got better at first I had tons of friends who I considered family I wasn t being bullied to my face And I was actually happy Then my second year of high school started and BOOM insomnia I became extremely irritable I was sleeping in class wasn t shaving dressing like shit and so on Well I didn t know this at the time but my cyclothymia lesser version of bipolar disorder had kicked into th gear What makes matters worse is I was already seeing a shrink and psychiatrist So I was getting medication But can you guess what meds I was getting Just anti depressants And for those who don t know ADs cyclothymia or bipolar disorder in my case hypomania What fun Basically for years I was mostly hypomanic I m sure you can all guess what this was like Well since one of the symptoms of hypomania is arrogance this got mistook for narcissism And a certain true narcissist didn t like this So he went around to all my friends who I considered family and told them I was this horrible person who thought all of them were less than me Which of course I didn t I saw almost all of them as my equal And then it gets better he decided to assume that I was also a liar because I mentioned that I fell into a firepit when I was a kid and melted my hand together But there s no scar So I must be lying Even tho it did really happen I ll find a way to prove it to you if you don t believe me He told everyone this So practically overnight my family was gone My insomnia had gotten to the point where I was staying awake from straight hours and to cope I turned to xanax and benadryl to sleep The fallout is obvious So I m left alone addicted to xanax going fucking mad from sleep deprivation and I dropped out of high school months later I had a nervous breakdown cyclothymia progressed to full blown bipolar disorder I start flying off the handle and punching holes in walls Smoking tons of weed to cope Struggling with xanax and ativan And I have no one Not a single person What s the point None of you will read this far down my rambling to read this I ruined everything But no I m apparently not allowed to be happy or have friends I just ruin everything,"Cause of Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Mental Distress",medium

A NoteI ve dealt with depression for at least years now I tried everything I could on my own to feel better eating well working out good sleep schedule etc Nothing worked I was in a type of medical school for a year and dropped out because I hated everything so much I now switched to computer science I definitely enjoy it more and I was hoping things would get better for me but I m still so unhappy It took me years to finally ask for help and see a doctor as I didn t want to worry my parents about it But finally I did a few months ago I saw my doctor and started an anti depressant Lexapro I was so so hopeful that this would help me but unfortunately things only got worse and worse These past months have been the absolute worst months of my life I m failing classes because I missed so many lectures assignments I have no money no job I ve isolated myself so much I just feel like I can t do anything I now feel as if I ve exhausted almost all my options for help and I just don t know what I can do anymore I have no desire to be in this world anymore I feel like I m just not cut out for it and I m okay with that There s so many other people out there my life is so small and meaningless anyway so what s it matter It sadly doesn t seem like it s worth all the trouble anymore And so many people have depression nowadays it s so sad I just fucking hate it here The only thing keeping me around is the pain that I know I will cause my friends and family if I do end things I wish it were acceptable to just make the choice yourself to give up and leave Well if anyone actually read this thanks I ve been really wanting to tell someone close to me how I ve been feeling but I feel like I can t put all this weight on their shoulders And honestly I do believe things could get at least somewhat better if I kept trying But I don t think I even have the desire to do that anymore It doesn t seem worth it I just want out I feel like such a disappointment to everyone and I m so sorry to everyone I ve let down I feel so bad for being such a financial and emotional burden on my parents I m so sorry mom and dad I don t think I can take it much longer,"Cause of Distress, Mental Distress, Progress Update, Seeking Help",medium

recap of my th year of life the worst one Today is my birthday and I tought I would write a post about all the shit that s been going on in my th year of life When I became everything was alright Good points in school lots of friends etc But then in march the corona hit Everyone stuck at home This wasn t too bad yet I could live with this I was bored of it after weeks April my mom came out as bisexual And she had a girlfriend She had been married to my dad for years or something now so this was a heavy hit My dad being very sad and my mom not knowing what to do just kinda didn t live in the same house anymore In the beginning mom would only go to her GF on Friday and Sunday It became more than that And more and more until she easily was over there for an entire week Now this GF was also married but they d been fighting for some time My mom s excuse to go there that much was to keep the fighting to a minimum In June moms GF and her husband divorced and now moms GF didn t have anywhere to sleep so she moved in with us until she bought herself a home This was very heavy on my dad and he would almost never sleep it looked like he cried every time he got up By the end of summer break mom and dad finally divorced and my mom moved in to her own house Moms GF has a house in a far away city since her kids go to school there October We ve been living like this for some time now Every Wednesday we switched the house we were living in My sister was suffering from frequent stomach aches and we went to the doctor with her Many doctors visits echoes and other scans later it turns out she had cancer in her liver But she was curable She almost immediately started chemo A few weeks later we had a bald girl running around the house By January it was decided she could stop chemo and get on the list for a liver donor Living in high stress and anticipation for a call from the hospital we continued Last Thursday we finally got the call By now she has gotten a new liver and is in the ICU The operation went better than expected being done almost hours earlier than expected And now we re here I m thinking of buying a D printer with my birthday money And I m now which means I can buy beer legally now,"Cause of Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Mental Distress, Positive Coping",medium

 i feel so so trapped and miserable im trying prozac again as i still had some extra from the last time i was on it hopefully it works well enough to get through a follow up appointment for more meds my anxiety is getting steadily worse since last december i used to be able to attend zoom meetings for more meds but the last time i tried to do that i had a horrible disassociating panic attack and had to cancel last minute going to the dentist to check for a cavity involved actual screaming and crying i had to reach a point of panic attack where i had gone numb and disassociated then i needed my partner to physically help me into the building i honestly dont know what to do in order to get help i have to push through my anxiety but when i try to do that my brain fully shuts down i cant answer questions and i get compelled to hit myself unfortunately sometimes i cant help myself and just start becoming violent towards myself only ever towards myself thankfully nothing permanently damaging just jarring and horrifying to feel almost possessed into hitting myself
 ive tried multiple meds ive tried every diy therapy tactic imaginable ive scoured resources for coping mechanisms nothing works when i get to a certain level of stress i shut down theres no coping or breathing through what feels like a complete shutdown of the brain i dont know how to get help at this point if one of my big three anxieties could go away i know it would help so much i just dont understand how to address any of those problems i need help honestly i dont know what im gonna do","Mood Tracking, Positive Coping",low

I desperately need help Hello I m a years old male college student I don t know where to begin I ll spare you my family problems I got over them I don t even know how to properly describe my situation I have no girlfriend nor I had many in the past I had two relationships that lasted less than a week when I was and the last one ended badly Six months ago I found out that my girlfriend of five months was cheating on me with two guys at the same time throught the whole period she spent with me She told me she felt pity for me and didn t want to dump me but she didn t really like me I fell as down as I ve ever fallen before as soon as she said that to me Even though I m socially akward I am also a good liar and I managed to make everyone believe I was fine confident and manly I didn t want my friends to feel bad for me so I dealt with my feelings when I was alone and faked confidence when I was with them My male friends constantly ask me for advices on how to be more like me because they think that I don t talk a lot because I m mysterious and other utter bullcrap like that They make me look cooler than I really am The reality is that I m a messed up guy who can t even talk without doing something cringyin and says that girls are not his priority to look cool just so that people don t wonder why he doesn t have one I cry myself to sleep everynight I usually sleep one to two hours everynight because of all the shit that goes on in my head Drinking wine has helped me with the thoughts and the insomnia but I ve recently stopped because I m scared of going down the alcoholic route which would make me feel even more pathetic These six months have been the darkest of my life so far All of my male friends have a girlfriend talk to me about how happy they are and I have to pretend I m happy for them In reality I just wish they all lost whatever they have out of jelousy I ve dumped all of my female friends because I m slowly becoming obsessed with not being friendzoned by girls Whenever an attractive friend of mine came up to me for advice I instantly felt like shit because she is treating me like a female friend Even newly met girls do that They don t even find me interesting enough to even consider dating me and straight up see me as an emotional dumpster The worst thing is that I actually try not to make myself view like that by avoiding giving advices and being the classic nice guy I am so not interesting that they fucking put me in the friendzone The last drop was today I ve been chatting with this girl for a couple of days she seemed interested since she always initiated contact touched me asked me very personal questions and in general her body language was telling me that she was interested I followed my usual line of thoughts by faking confidence and pretending my life was all good and interesting also because I have no interest in boring a stranger to death with my personal problems Today she hugged me and told me she loves me like a fucking brother I ve managed to put myself in the friendzone in not even a fucking week I don t know I just don t know She is now texting me and I don t want to answer her because I know she wants a friendship out of me and I do not want to give her that My pride is no more I don t want to talk about it with my friends because the way they see me is probably the only one good thing about my life I m also supposed to go to a party tonight and she is going to be there I think I ll stay home I don t know,"Cause of Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Mental Distress, Seeking Help",medium
I dont see things getting much betterClearly if I m posting here im not wanting to die In fact I really wish life could be better for me I just dont believe I will get better My issues come from a lot of trauma and I ve been in therapy for more than years I consistently do things to try to better my life I try to make healthier decisions I try to be a better person and I try to employ the fake it til you make it method of being happy not in a disingenuous way just trying to make good habits I have some good days I have some comfortable and quiet days I do not necessarily have happy days And more so than the former I have a lot of really hard moments and days I m tired of feeling haunted I m tired of the hauntings always coming back and always getting in the way I feel like I m doing everything I can maybe I m not i dont know But at what point is it just the rational decision to accept the reality of circumstance There are plenty of people trapped to cycles of mindsets and behaviors they cannot change or are almost incapable of changing On my best days I do not believe in much besides biology and chance Things have no meaning besides what you give them If I were capable of feeling safe and comfortable then I would be happy finding things that I have meaning in And i try to do this But I can t have the basic foundation of stability On my worst days I am convinced that the world or at least my own world is plagued with pain The one thing I can believe in is pain It is consistent and promised and not fake I cannot believe in anything else as genuinely as I can pain At what point is limiting the amount of pain I continue to endure or encounter the more rational decision rather than being a sitting duck waiting for the next trauma to come Or the next affirmation that I cannot trust myself nor others Or the next proof that there is no good around me I dont want to wait for those things My hauntings convince me those things are coming whether they are or not Which makes those things reality anyways I m tired of the moments where I feel completely despaired and fearful Not even entirely sure what my body and mind are dreading most of the time sometimes my mind just rationalizes that intense fear by creating paranoid thoughts And then I lose my sense of self and reality even more It s awful to have flashbacks and nightmares and then paranoia Its awful to believe everything can and will hurt me I m tired,"Mental Distress, Positive Coping",medium

How on Earth do I get past this I suffer from anxiety and undiagnosed depression and I will explain more about my undiagnosed depression down below Onto my confession For a while I have been having horrible depression days and a whole bunch of suicidal thoughts My thoughts range from extremely graphic to somewhat peaceful I ve even researched the perfect ways to die and what not to do Of course I do not want to give anyone else ideas on how to end their own lives but that is just a thing that calms me down and makes me calm down and look at possible options to make it quick and painless for both me and possibly the crime scene cleaners I do live with my parents and I definitely struggle with all the questions people do not usually think of once they died I have to go away from myself and look at what others might experience Who would find the body How much of a mess would I make if I do decide to end it early What would people think afterwards Would my current image to others change due to me killing myself and having them know I was depressed How would I explain everything while still keeping a good image of myself to others How would I make it easier to help my family move on and help them grieve when they need to While I put away everything I own who should I write it for Should I clean everything so it wouldn t be a burden for others Should I place everything I own in storage boxes so they can throw out everything that they do not want or need anymore Should I record my voice and turn it into a CD saying all their names and how much I love them Or should I just end it suddenly with no explanation so they don t know how dark my mind was when I was alive I don t plan on really going through with it currently due to the questions stated earlier I would never want my mom or dad ever finding my body that would break any parent for finding their child s body Honestly I really really need help but I can t afford to ruin my current image to others I can t get help myself because I am under and I need a parent or guardian to sign off on my treatment and I don t want them to have to pay for my care I can t just tell them because they would worry and reflect on themselves to see if they did anything wrong which they did not and they would never look at me the same way after If I told my psychiatrist she would be worried about me again and tell my parents who would again worry and be stressed about me The nearest psychiatric hospital is apparently not very good and has a large history of r pe and the hospital is not very sanitary The staff are also reported as not caring or being rude to the patients My depression has been very tough on me and I am too scared to tell my psychiatrist or parents that I may need antidepressants because I again fear them not looking at me the same afterwards Also there would be several uncomfortable questions and I don t want my parents to worry about me more than they already do I have already caused enough stress for my parents with my anxiety and quiting public school and going to an online school in which I am severely behind on due to not being motivated and stressed when my parents constantly tell me to do my work and just get over it It s very stressful and I have breakdowns a lot but I do it in secret because my mom tell me that s life and suck it up I only tell my mom what s wrong with me because my dad is quite hard to talk to about mental health because he doesn t understand But my mom is starting to get at the end of her rope with me and starting to get angry if I tell her I had a panic attack or cry in front of her It definitely makes me feel closed in and I am afraid to tell her these things now because she gets frustrated with me and blames me as her defense She has a habit of blaming me as her defense mechanism and I take what she says to heart and use that to constantly critize myself I am my biggest critic and so is my mom For a time after I was diagnosed she was more gentile and showed more empathy with me but over the years since that she has became more frustrated with me I ve been lying on my schoolwork and tell her I do it when in reality I cry and sleep to get away from it all She constantly calls and texts me to see if I m doing my schoolwork and I tell her yes and I cry after the call because I am so behind and so stressed that I might have to redo my sophomore year of high school and that terrifies me I already have to go back in January and I will have to overlap some of my current schoolwork just to get enough credits for sophomore year I can t tell her this because she will get frustrated with me and most likely take my computer away which I use constantly to get the thoughts away I always have to have music or YouTube going just to not think about everything that I have to do and even then it doesn t help When I try and do the schoolwork I become overwhelmed and cry I play the sims to get away from everything and my mom is constantly telling me to do work she wants me to do school work for over hours when she s home I can t focus and I want to end it but I can t with all the liabilities I just want it to end and not be

funded school it would be far cheaper and just as good an education than the college I was at But at the same time I realized I wanted to move out of New York Either way over in interest accruing debt from that measly two semesters of college I urgently needed a job of course to pay rent in the mean time I lived in Brooklyn for a year in two awful living situations with crazy roommates I couldn t move back home because my brother has severe violent anger issues and has used racial slurs including the n word in the past and my mother is a horrible alcoholic That was years ago in Since then I have gone through more applications trial runs and interviews than I can count With no degree and no specific skill or experience I have applied to mostly stores and some restaurants in that time I ended up moving back home with my mother and now she pays rent for my brother s apartment in a town over Not because of me because she kicked him out The longest job I had was as a cashier at a Stop amp Shop for months I worked full time hours most weeks more than hours a week but they thinly skirted the system so as not to give me healthcare I ended up quitting because they gave me hell about using the bathroom Seriously the people who were supposed to cover me would refuse to let me use the bathroom and would call me on the loudspeaker when I had only been in there a couple minutes It got so bad that I could never relax enough to pee Damnably I still have the problem to this day I ve tried everything I quit the job in April almost a year ago and well before that the urination problem

food pantry in my town Since then I ve applied to so many jobs I ve lost the people I used to talk to because they started blaming me saying I wasn t doing enough and it was my fault too No friends I m a virgin which I don t care about I don t compare myself to people and I hate the predominant culture that assigns value to such things anyway always have I m so poor that dating and relationships are impossibly distant anyway I don t talk to my mother anymore at all She is an alcoholic that neglected and abused me and my brother our entire lives and feels zero remorse and blames and vilifies me for every little thing every chance she gets Her father physically assaulted my brother and flat out told me the one time I tried to reach out to him that he doesn t want to see me or ever deal with my problems Needless to say he drinks and verbally abusive to his wife too He took my mother s side when I left home at one point because of how bad my mother was house hopping with friends I no longer have before I went to college My mother is a compulsive hoarder and the entire apartment is a mess so I ve never had guests over and it s hard to cook food I m vegetarian so all I eat is oats cereal spaghetti and occasionally frozen vegetables But even that is hard because the kitchen is such a mess and if I tried to clean it she would scream at me for throwing something away or make it messy again and blame the mess on me My father is out of the picture the last time he emailed me he blamed me for leaving college and doing nothing He has a new wife and daughter and lives in Japan Needless to say I don t think he deserves to know how hard I ve been trying against the grain of everything I don t drink smoke or do any drugs of any kind Never have never will Never had the slightest interest in it This makes me even more isolated almost everybody at least in New York City does I d rather be alone than be friends with any of them no question The only way I could theoretically have a life again is if I find a job save up earn money to move out I knew it would be hard but I don t mind working at least hours a week standing all day focusing on the job waking up early and coming home every day when it s dark I m used to it I have a great work ethic and am polite to everyone Just recently I lost two jobs at a pharmacy and waffle shop in my town Why They just Didn t Like me They refused to give me an explanation I kept myself busy the entire time took notes was diligent and polite to everyone And nothing Just now my mother threatened to evict me Unlike my brother who was drinking and fighting with her I keep to myself She threatened to kick me out because the neighbors in the apartment make up lies about noise I know the noise is not coming from me because I am always quiet but she believes them Wants me gone Has talked about air bnb ing my room She never loved or wanted me and only sees me as a problem and a burden and would prefer me dead More money and space for her I try not to think about how horrible she is because the opposite of love isn t hate it s indifference I need to just focus on my own life finding a job to be my own independent person and focus on things that matter to me As I told her before she is not my mother So I feel nothing but once in a while in push come to shove situations like this I have a nervous breakdown So one time the police came because a neighbor called them because I couldn t stop screaming and crying But that had nothing to do with the noise complaints this was recently and after them I m positive I don t want kids I got a vasectomy from Planned Parenthood They gave me weird energy and so did the doctor I saw later about the urination Your average person thinks you ll regret it or you just got it because of the way YOUR parents were In reality I am not bringing a son or daughter into this world that has to deal with the problems of this world They would have to deal with all of the political social and climate resource related problems in the world They wold have to deal with heartbreak loss work suffering have the possibility of an accident or unbelievable agony from illness know they will die And at the end of course die I can t look into the eyes of my beloved child knowing they will die I don t not believe in God or the afterlife I KNOW that God or the afterlife doesn t exist Biologically people are dead and dead for good There are enough people that know they are alive and know they will die Theoretically I could be just as happy without kids and a family I have no idea how with all of this but I volunteer every Friday in Brooklyn taking a commute that is over hours both ways It s not really surprising it s my only connection to the outside world because I have no friends here in the suburb I grew up in and am stuck living in now I m not close friends with any of the people there though and it s led to nothing I never tell them about all of this and occasionally if someone asks how I am and I say anything less than great they would think I don t appreciate what I have since I don t pay rent Some of them like me but it s nothing if I can t get a job to move on with my life which I can t Every day is unbearable Theoretically I am a like able person but none of it in practice matters After all is said and done the final question is why do I not see a therapist Why not talk about this to them instead of this website One word medication I had a bad experience with one that I had since middle school who got so fascist about it he would refuse to talk to me unless I took it Which I did one mg pill of Prozac In case you didn t know that s the smallest possible dose of a mild antidepressant that takes weeks to kick in or taper down from You can laugh at this I took one pill and my balls started to hurt My body literally rebelled against it That was how much I was badgered into doing something I didn t want to do He wasn t a psychiatrist but he was connected to the one I saw who prescribed the Prozac So I quit both of them This was soon after I left college in I know most psychologists therapists would be the same way Blame me Something is wrong with me I don t know a lot but I know they are wrong I know how intelligent polite self motivated I am Every problem I have ever had has been reacting to external circumstance and with that a lot of patience and fortitude If I had money everything could be different I would have time space a place of my own and would live alone I would still work but using my gifts for the world Or even a drudgery job I wouldn t care But as it is my life has been my mother and brother their constant threats and abuse stuck in it with every effort to proceed with my life rebuffed and actively painful thrown back in my face When I lived in an apartment I could only afford one with roommates who were also psychotic My own ticket to salvation a job I have been trying to find one and failing for years with countless problems and crazy people at them I have been so patient with but even there I leak out the side sometimes They would say I have anxiety emotional problems ADHD trouble focusing and need medication And that if I don t take it I m immature blaming other people instead of taking responsibility I could not possibly be more mature or responsible If I wasn t these things this entire post would be hate for my parents for not giving me money But what is it It s focusing on the fact that I can t get jobs or even at least unemployment benefits so I can eat and survive while I look for one But I accept that because I can t change it and even then focus on getting jobs And I know that medication is not the answer At the end of the day I am finding myself lacking the willpower I still try to apply to jobs but every day strangles me more than the last The very motivation is stifled because everything of my body and mind has learned that all of my efforts boomerang back in my face It s so hard to try when the job people yell at me and blame me and think false things of me no different than my mother It s terrible that it has come to this but more and more lately I think how suicide would be a sweet escape No more pain or suffering This can t be denied The only reason not to do it is that there s a possibility of things getting better and being happy in the future I know I can never be happy living with my mom that s for sure So I ve held on all this time on the possibility that I might get a job and move out I see a lot of posts here saying things like Everyone says it will get better and It won t get better Slowly I am waking up to the fact that these things are no less true for me Of course part me wants to live But as I realize further and further the impossibility of getting that chance at least not having to suffer anymore slowly becomes more and more enticing The one post I won t tolerate is saying go to college in New York now I hate New York and everything about it and am positive I want to move Do not say there is no heaven or wherever you go there you are or anything of the sort I am not in the slightest idealistic and I know everywhere has problems no less than I know that the only possibility of me being happy is moving If it took more than years to save up enough to move while living here I would accept that if I knew that once I moved out I would never have to live with my mom again but at the same time I would rather die than live here for another years in this condition while also being busy in college and having zero to show for it except less money and more debt This goes for years community college also Or living in the city which I also hate and I know there are no perfect cities no less than I know there are cities substantially different than New York City And I am never living in a dorm situation again From experience at two different colleges I know it s a nightmare with zero independence or privacy I want to get a job save up move to a city and go to a city funded college in the city whilst having a job to support myself I m positive I want to go to The West Coast or Europe I am realizing that it may be impossible and so the only other possibility is death You could say I could move to a place with a job with the degree but then I should be able to move with a job without that This world is evil There is a caste system that kills young people that have no skills by only letting them have kitchen or customer service jobs kicking them out of that blaming them denying their survival unemployment food stamps housing while they look for a job and the only way out is to take out a loan and being in debt for thousands if not hundreds of thousands of dollars This is the most evil plutocratic thing ever The world is truly by and for the rich My friend who I no longer really talk to since he blames me for not having a job has EU citizenship through his mother and lives in France as a full citizen He is the luckiest person I know My mother was born in the USA but my father in Iran I sometimes think of getting Iranian citizenship since I wouldn t have to pay for college small potatoes compared to the work of learning Farsi Recently a thought has come to mind that describes my life I am asking for nothing and I can t even have that If I was asking for a house a car a job that paid enough to support a wife pets and two kids it would be different but I m not asking for any of that I just want to live alone have at least some time to pursue things like art that matter to me even if that always has to be on a shoestring budget and any mediocre job that is at least manageable if not difficult This has not been difficult it has been an impossible ideal No wonder I am depressed An unemployed no degree half Iranian year old NEET teetotalism virgin living in the USA the most murderous war machine in the world run by Donald Trump with a psychotic Nazi for a brother an absent father who thinks I m a loser and an alcoholic verbally abusive insane mother with zero friends an empty wallet and bank account rejected from every job every type of job every place over years because I am told I am incompetent anxious loser when in reality I am as hard working as they come I ll always know that the problem wasn t my negative thinking Everyone says change to more positive thoughts first if you want your life to change Nothing could inaccurately reflect my situation more than this I have had so much hope in all of my efforts for something to change or happen through those very efforts itself mind you not just waiting for things to change I ve gotten it out and even for this board it s a very long post No offence to anyone here but I see a lot of posts with a lot of missing capitalization punctuation grammar and spelling mistakes My grammar is anything but perfect or ideal but relatively speaking my writing is pretty polished if not only superficially as opposed to structurally I don t take pride in this but I hope if nothing else the effort to clearly articulate everything thus far shows If you ve gotten this far you must have a thing for reading the thoughts of depressed strangers on the internet Even if not one person reads it I at least typed all of it up And even if someone does at most they can just reply just cold words on the computer screen that might as well be my own In spite of everything I just said you can say whatever you want I would rather have people s sincere thoughts and feelings not be stifled from coming out After all nothing in the planet makes me angrier than the fact that the job people can t even tell me why they fire me A gun is put to my head and my last wish is to know why I have to die and they laugh as they pull the trigger It is one trillion times more damning and insulting that they hold back on account of my feelings or because they can t be bothered to tell me why they do not hire me than the fact that they reject me to begin with I ve never had a problem of cyber bullying because it s just words on the screen Say every awful thing if it s what you really honestly feel about me I ll appreciate the honesty even I assume people are reasonably nice here but the logic still applies At the end of the day I want what everyone wants to be happy But I ve given up on that I have tried for years which is one fifth of my lifespan If I cannot be happy at least I can not be unhappy For now I will keep trying on an empty tank of gas every day more emotionally stifling and painful than the last But like everything there is a limited capacity to this And unless suddenly my luck changes the capacity will eventually be reached And I do not believe in luck I only use it metaphorically as metaphorical as it would be to mention my situation improving Until then no thoughts well wishes feelings or prayers can help me Only tangible improvement which I know damn well can only be brought about by my own efforts which the blamers that is to say everyone I make the mistake of mentioning all of this to love to tell me more than anything I am making those efforts You know the results Medical problems more rejection violence more pain The tangible improvement will either come first or death by my own hands which I have had unfathomable patience already in holding off from But sooner or later the logic of it will become clear I don t want to die anymore than my biology wants to survive What will happen will happen but either way I dread the pain of the future,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update, Seeking Help",high

I can t speak Ever since I was a child I ve had a stutter Not a mild one think of the Kings Speech that one hits closer to home I spent my school life listening to everyone chat laugh sing whisper but could never do it myself I would sit in the classroom at my allocated spot at the table hearing questions being thrown out to the room which I knew the answer to and beyond all other wanting in that moment all I craved was to raise my hand and answer it like a normal school boy would I just couldn t Instead I would sit there within my impenetrable silent bubble I d found myself in and daydream of a future where I would become an adult and have a happy life my stutter non existent Ten years later I m an adult with a medicore job with some great friends of whom I m very lucky to have My family friends and colleagues all know of my affliction but as they do not have one themselves all they see is someone with a mundane speech impediment who needs a little longer to get his words out They and I assume most people who can speak fluently and articulatory without hindrance don t understand or realise the mental and emotional turmoil it can create In this day and age everything is based around communication Want to apply for a job Sit down for an hour in front of two people and answer questions on you why you want to spend your free precious time filling up the cheeses on aisle six for pennies Need cancel a subscribion Buy a house doctors appointment Give them a ring only to have them hang up when they think that nobody is there because you can t say a simple Hello Or perhaps you want to go to the shops to buy a new coffee machine when the nice lady walks up to you and asks you if you need any help today completely unaware of the battle which is raging deep down inside of you Struggling to breathe facial contortions colour shifting from milky white to beetroot red Being so aware of every millisecond that passes and just before the words come out finally you realise that she is looking at you funny with a hint of fear It s degrading Humiliating Demasculating Knowing that I am of sound mind just trying to get by with life but whenever I need to speak to someone they think something is wrong in my head and avoid me I go from the friendly looking chap standing by the toasters to someone they regret walking over to because I am not acting normal And worse of all The hardest thing for me to say is stutter So I can t even tell people what s going on so they never realise Every waking hour of my life is dedicated to my stutter It s always there looming behind every choice I make It s an invisible disease eating away at confidence from the inside out until a shallow husk remains filled only with anxiety with lost dreams and opportunities If this is to be my life then it is not worth living Watching peers around you progress and move up to a better life when I can t even make a phone call without being hung up on Suicide has always been in a different reality to me Seemed too far away or unrealistic to see it properly However as time goes on I can only see a very bleak future for me in this life I don t think it will be very long now until I take the plunge,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk",high

i dont know know what to doi hate saying this but i don t know what to do i am and in my mind i am thinking wow how pathetic i m of course i m suicidal and seeking attention but i have felt like this since i was a little kid but even worse now my mom always yelled at me about how i m going to grow up to be homeless and a failure all just because i didn t do a simple chore i was always lazy and shit i m so weak why am i complaining when there are other people getting abused and neglected constantly and i m crying all because my dad called me useless and i can never be serious in front of my friends so they ll never believe me if said i want to kill myself all i want is to be happy again my hobby is cooking and usually do that when i m in a good mood i stopped cooking for a month and i would stay in my room locked up and only get a few hours of sleep and then miss school my parents noticed i was being weird but the thing is i don t think they believe i could ever be depressed either that or they just don t know anything about mental illnesses i can t really self diagnose myself but i did stop eating and i didn t want to talk to anyone and i didn t laugh or get angry all my grades in school dropped and that made me feel even more horrible my dad asked me if i was getting bullied but i wasn t and he said that s all he could think of i know they care for me but it s kinda hard to believe that when today my dad yelled at me and it s usually my mom who yells at me but he said you are not an adult and you can t just do whatever the hell you want you keep giving us an attitude and i m sick and tired of it he said a whole lot of other stuff and i know my parents work and shit just to come home to keep my brother and i happy it s just that you can t buy happiness and they keep doing that they buy me whatever to keep me happy but it only makes them mad and i don t want them to just keep giving me shit because i m trying to make it easy for them but then they get mad and call me spoiled and make me feel like shit i want to talk to them but every time i do they just say what because they are old and they can barely hear so i speak louder and then they think i m giving them an attitude and then they mad at me and then i can t really tell them how i feel they refuse to get hearing aids or at least something to help them hear they are always mad and keep disappointing them they are both old fashioned so whatever is happening to me they don t understand i just don t know if can live like this no one can help me i m stuck here thinking i m a failure and i am i want to die every person i talk to tells me it will get better but how can you say that when it just gets worse i even managed to cut myself and it didn t hurt it did but i didn t care i don t know why i cut myself why did i cut myself today i don t know what s wrong with me,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update, Seeking Help",high

That s the oldest I ve ever been It s the oldest I m ever meant to be I don t remember when I had the first dream It probably happened when I was so young that I wouldn t even be able to remember They are always fragmented and real Real in the way that when it ends your eyes open and you re lying in bed wondering Did I just wake up or just fall asleep The fragments don t seem to follow a timeline just clips like a hazy recollection of a night out Remembering moments out of a long series of events In these dreams I ve seen the events of my life tragic and wonderful play out before me Sometimes months or years before they are experienced in the chronological timeline It took time to get used to having these dreams especially the dark ones the ones where a friend or family member passes and I m forced to spectate as a silent observer in their final moments It wasn t until my teens that I felt like I understood what they were As stupid as it sounds clairvoyance runs in the family If you believe in that type of thing I ve cousins who experience the same We ve talked about them shared our different perspectives of events yet to come and those that we didn t understand until the timeline unfolded in front of us Out of the thousands of dreams every one of which that has so far played in my synapses not one of them shows me past the age of My th birthday is now less than days away I ve lived with suicidal ideation for nearly two decades now Before I had ever met my wife I had come to a decision I wasn t going to live past the age of in fact I was going to end my life on my th birthday I can t say for certain why I chose Partially because I was an angst filled young adult who thought if I was going to die young I should join the group of others who died famously young at except I m far from famous also happens to be my favorite number I could not tell you why I ve always just been drawn to it When my th birthday rolled around I was a newlywed of months To say that ending my life on that day was the last thing on my mind then would be to lie to you The plan I d concocted still toiled about in my brain that day But my plans had changed It began to stand out in my mind that the dreams never showed me past a certain age The limit was always twenty nine There are none where I m a proud father watching my children go None of me in my golden years enjoying life with my wife who s aged so much better than I over the years After they just stop We fixate on negatives humans that is It s an exercise in willpower and determination to train ourselves to focus on the positives in life and not dwell on the negatives I m far from being a master at this myself Why don t I see myself as older than in any of these Is it because that s when my story ends Will my life be destined to have a dash between Am I finally going to break in the next two months and have the gumption to take my own piece off the game board Or is it something more positive Does the family s clairvoyant trait only take us so far in life Is it a gift we are given to be shown in part the events of our future that will violently shape the people we will become Glimpses to show us that no matter how low and dark things are going to get you are going to make it through this Maybe we aren t clairvoyant Odds are it s just the family disposition for schizophrenia another wonderful future to look forward to thanks to inherited genetics I ve already been dealing with auditory hallucinations since childhood though one might argue those spawned from abuse and not genetics Is it going to end at am I going to see the other side of If I don t is it going to be my own doing Maybe I m not allowed to see how my own story ends not until I experience it first hand so as to not spoil the moment I don t make a conscious effort to avoid my suicidal ideation I did at one point but then I accepted that part myself The part that feels knows that suicide is an option I can t say I go more than a week without at least the tiniest thought of it coming into my mind That thought of throwing yourself into the void when staring into it The thoughts just happen and like other thoughts they are sometimes discarded immediately Others are turned and inspected what if situations played out over and over How would she react What would the funeral look like How many dominos would fall if I cast my own down Some may topple like my own but there would be many that would wobble for ages Likely never settling back down into their original position That s the hardest hurdle for me in regard to bringing myself to committing to ending it myself My empathy for those in my life knowing or at least thinking I know how my life ending would impact theirs More so if it was self inflicted It has always been easy to hurt myself Intentionally hurting others that I care about though has always felt impossible I know I ve caused harm to them without the intention of doing so and felt immense guilt after the fact again and again So I ve never been able to follow through with a plan because of the line of thinking that happens at that point of the planning Within the next two months am I going to finally disregard others feelings and selfishly satisfy my own I m not even sure what to call it desire or what I believe to be my stories already written ending Perhaps it does end but not by any doing of myself Just the chaos of existence With some luck maybe Just maybe isn t the end It s just a new beginning,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk",high

"I am doing HORRIBLE. I can't stop thinking about my fp. It's been nearly two weeks since he has messaged me. What did I do?
 
 The last time we hung out, I subtly described to him that he's my favorite person. I didn't use any bpd terms, but I just sort of told him how much I appreciate and admire him, and how I find myself relying on him and being dependent on him often.
 He didn't seem weirded out, he even reciprocated a bit. He told me stuff like ""I love hanging out with you too."" ""I love being friends too.""
 He told me that... so why? Why is he ignoring me?
 CW: self harm ideation
 
  It hurts so badly, it hurts so badly I've been wanting to cut to just make the pain physical.
 I don't understand why he would say such sweet and nice things to me and immediately ignore me for 2 weeks.
 
 I've been telling myself over and over how much I hate him and how much I want to cut him out completely.
 But it's not true...I really don't want to cut him out. I want to stay friends and I want to be someone he can rely on too.
 I'm IN LOVE with him. I love him so much it hurts me every day because I can never have him and I'm wasting my time.
 
 I'm kept up at night thinking about what I might have done wrong.
 I might have scared him away? Maybe he didn't mean all those nice things he said, he must have only said them to quell me.
 
 I honestly would rather he tell me he thinks I'm a freak and that he never wants to speak to me again...instead of doing whatever this is.
 It is pure and complete AGONY. I'm losing my mind. 
 I just want to shut off and not think about anything ever.","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk",high

Paranoid verbally abused heart racing racing thoughts I have been diagnosed with Schizoaffective disorder That basically means that I sometimes have problems controlling my mood or my way of thinking isn t aligned with reality sometimes So I was invited to dinner with my family for Passover and everything was all fine and dandy Then everyone left and we said our goodbyes I helped my mom with the table and some other cleaning around the kitchen I asked if she needed anymore help and she said no In response I asked if I could use the upstairs massage chair and she said ok So I went upstairs unbothered for about minutes to use the chair Keep in mind that I wasn t bothering anyone and was minding my own business No harm no foul The chair has a timer on it so that I know how much time remains At around minutes left my mom s husband stepfather whatever you want to call it comes upstairs to switch it off and he starts to belittle me with his words how this is his house and that I need his permission to use it So I left and walked downstairs away from him but he just wouldn t shut up like a broken record I went to the kitchen and followed soon after I asked mom if she needed some help and NOW she said that her husband helped her out AFTER she specifically told me that she didn t need anymore help Then I continued to distance myself from him and still no talking He s like You can be seen but not heard I understand if a grown up tells that to a child but I m here Don t I have a right to defend myself if I am being verbally or physically abused even if it means expressing my point of view with a shaky voice I told him ENOUGH but he still continues to talk I m not a little kid I got the point minutes ago and he still gabbers on and on and on Then I go upstairs to the second floor of the house to get my belongings and leave But he prevents me by blocking the doorway and still rambles on I m telling you he REALLY knows how to piss someone off Then after I grab my things and head toward the door he has the audacity to extend his hand to say bye All I do is walk past him put on my slippers and leave on my bicycle In the middle of all the arguments and the created tension my mom continued to defend him Like WTF I didn t do anything to anybody and if he didn t want me to use it he should have said so from the get go So I m seriously going to consider an ultimatum either mom divorces him or I will follow through with my suicide I just can t continue to live in fear like this I thought he would change but I was just being delusional Last time I checked it was also my mom s house and she has lived there longer than he has He moved in with her back in but she has lived there for over years stretching way back into the s I m telling you right now if I don t commit suicide my paranoid thoughts will lead me to believe that he will come to my apartment and threaten to kill me I am only miles away from where they live because my mom helped me with an apartment close to her I guess for protection He can at any time take the card to the community open the door to the building and unlock my front door The problem with him is that he likes to pursue things till the very end It s always one sided in his case I don t say anything but he just talks and talks to no end The things he does to empower himself is really sick and I m the one with the disorder Never ending verbal abuse and condescending tone with him I am seriously considering filing a restraining order against him I have never filed a restraining order against anyone but he might be the first The problem is it takes time to make it official and the decision is tentative because they have to hear out not only my side of the story but his as well I m worried that the court might take his side over mine and revoke my attempt to issue the restraining order I don t want to wait to be physically injured to use that as evidence to justify my support for the restraining order He might be married to my mom and live in the same household as her but that doesn t give him the right to treat me the way he does And who knows how he treats my mom behind closed doors I m know I m repeating myself but it has to be said I know I was a guest in my mom s home but I m no stranger and I wasn t disturbing anybody If anything it was like my presence wasn t even in the house until you actually came into the room That s how quiet I was Typing some of this out in writing in my quiet apartment has helped calm my mood a little bit but I am still feeling highly anxious about the situation I don t provoke anyone and I mind my own business Don t start nothing and there won t be nothing I live by that motto P S I flipped him the bird yesterday while I was trying on new clothes after he told me to suck it in It s not just HOW he said it but the WAY he said it with a smug look on his face and arrogant tone He was obviously referring to my stomach I have body fat and I have a flat stomach with a little bit of fat around the sides but not much abs Regardless he just HAS to talk shit just to feel better about himself The things he does to boost his self esteem,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update, Seeking Help",high

"So, a little background. I'm a 23 year old male with a BS in physics and applied math. So I'm somewhat intelligent (this is relevant). About a month ago, I saw an article on reddit (can't remember the sub) about a doctor who was helping people with an issue that seemed similar to what I'm experiencing. The best way that I can describe it with how the article described it, is that you come to a conclusion on something that *could* happen (or start thinking about *why* something happened in the past the way it did), and you basically go on a logic train to hell, where you follow a bunch of illogical conclusions that build up into a horribly unrealistic scenario. However, if someone asks about how you got to the scenario, they can see your logic that brought you to that last conclusion because they can follow your logic even though the logic is unrealistic. The problem is I can't for the life of me think of what the disease is called.
 
 On the topic of the intelligence part, the article talked about the doctor having to use techniques for this one patient because he was intelligent and the normal treatment wouldn't really work with him. Basically he could see past simple logic problems, but not advanced ones. I think this is where I'm at right now.

My Girlfriend Tried to Commit Suicide Today I m Not Supposed to Talk to Her Anymore I Need Help Long one guys but I m fucking shaking I have no one to talk to about this I started Dating Aly about a year ago Found her on tinder Turned out we went to the same middle school yada yada Aly has kids with the same father I am the father of a nearly year old We are both yrs old When we started dating she told me about her past Let s just say she hasn t had it easy Father committed suicide A failed marriage Etc I m also not in the best place right now My own custody battle is a story of its own and it s as bad as you can imagine Like that YT video of the lady fighting with the kids father about their haircut type of bad Since my son was born I decided to turn my life around Become more responsible get a degree yada yada I m actually proud to say that I ve already gotten an associate s degree bought a house been promoted It s not all been smooth But I m starting to see the changes I set out to make But I m way far from where I would like to be Not done by a long shot I literally see my son days out of the month and it fucking kills me It feels like torture Slow painful torture So anyways Aly s place was just down the street from mine So she would be over all the time and eventually her kids too So six months later she asked to move in I immediately raised some flags Reminded her about my situation with my kid going to school hour long weeks getting home at PM and working on the computer until AM I told her I had lived on my own since I left my parents and I literally didn t even know how to coexist with another human being She said she understood and it didn t matter She was also paying a month for rent and spending half the time at my place so from a financial perspective it did make sense So I reluctantly agreed Aly is amazing And I mean amazing She would like do everything around my house even though I would beg her not to She fucking loves my kid so much And it s genuine When he was diagnosed with autism she started researching got some type of autism therapy degree and just overall looks after him like if it was her own I ll go as far as to say that Aly is by far a better mom to my son that his actual give the kid an iPad and ignore him for the whole night evil spirited ass shitty excuse for a mother mother God I hate her So fast forward months and Aly has completely changed Lost extreme weight Taking prescription pills this palpable sadness always in her stare I know what s up immediately Because she told me She wanted more She wanted a baby with me She wanted me to say I love you back when she said it she wanted me to text her more take ker out more often Travel You know the little things And you know what She was right to want all those things She deserved them She had life throw every single bad scenario at her and she still turned out amazing Raised amazing kids Helped me with everything Hell yeah she deserved every single thing she asked for and much more I decided to be blunt it s hard for me to say no and I often commit to things that I know I don t want or can t do and I told her that at least for the time being Nothing about our relationship was going to be any different I am still committed to getting my life together and most importantly more time with my son I told I wasn t ready to have a baby I told her I probably wasn t going to travel and do all the things she wanted At least not very often Or actually not often at all But I told her she didn t have to settle around my plans and I understood if she didn t It would be selfish for me to ask her to just ride it out for a few years knowing full well she would do it if I asked I couldn t bear seeing her sad I couldn t bear knowing I was the cause of all that pain She shouldn t have to feel bad for wanting those things and put up with someone who wasn t as invested in the relationship as she was Man she didn t take it well She told me she didn t want to cause me any trouble or feel unwanted somewhere and that she would be out by the next day I told her she wasn t unwanted I was perfectly fine with the current situation I just knew that she wasn t I knew that she was sad And that I wasn t going to lie to her or lead her on The next day everything was fine As if nothing had happened Almost like if the conversation itself was all that she needed and she even seemed happy I dare say That same day I get this weird text from my kids mom Asking me to accompany her to an xray procedure for our son super weird that she would ask me to come along And to help her do her taxes I showed the text Aly and she said yeah she is just trying to spend the day with you Which I agreed was probably the case Nonetheless I told Aly I would go to the xray procedure because if anything else it would be a chance to see my son even if for a short period And that I definitely wouldn t be doing anyone s taxes As I m in the hospital something happened something finally snapped with Aly I get a frantic call from her friend that Aly had phoned her ex husband saying to take care of the kids and that she would be taking a bunch of pills Cops paramedics family Everyone rushed over to help her She had indeed taken a bunch of pills I heard about Xanax of whatever mg but idk if that s even possible some wine and slights cuts to her wrist She was rushed to the hospital and is now in stable condition Her family is not mad at me They told me that Aly sorta has a history of just straight up tragedy after tragedy turns out the guy she dated after her husband who she was madly in love with just randomly died of a heart attack and told me that the best thing I could do if I truly care about her is to block her number To not let her in my house To make sure I let her know I am absolutely not interested in even talking to her I understand the rational But man how can I just straight up ignore someone who has done so much for me I know it s not

Day of walking away from a toxic friendship She scares me Yesterday was the first time I ve felt a sense of self after walking away from a seven year toxic friendship She d conditioned me to rely on her for all my happiness so I couldn t walk away Now thinking about it she scares me She scares me because not only is she a bully and a bitch she s incredibly smart She s scary because she knows exactly how to manipulate others and use them to her whim without them ever saying a word about it It takes an incredibly strong person to walk away from her the only three I know of that have ever broken her hold on them are my best friend one other guy friend and myself There s others who ve seen through her before being drawn in though which takes a very perceptive person to do,Positive Coping,low

I want to kill myself next month on my birthday Turning I have some sort of mental illness I don t know what I have a few theories but I d hate to self diagnose It use to be manageable I had a very loving girlfriend who use to help me and make me feel better I was always open about myself to her but I wasn t very open about my darkside until towards the end of our relationship She realized how bad it was Likewise she also suffered from mental illness and along with that she survived through various forms of abuse throughout her life She broke up with me because I made an egregious mistake which though wasn t built on bad intentions was horrid in its affect I hurt her and I can only hope that she gets better I love her so so much We re trying to be friends but it s obvious that it hurts her healing process to talk to me She was the only person who I felt ever actually cared for me She was the one person who I ever felt emotionally secure with She was the one person who I felt actively cared for me and my well being in that she would worry about me and check up on me Now I don t have her and now I have nothing Its my fault I just want to hug her I hate the way time works When something happens it happens and theres no way you can change it My relationship with my parents is strange My dad is an alcoholic and probably bipolar Sometimes he and I get along but when I m being myself he often calls me weird strange retarded pretentious etc He does it jokingly often times ganging up with my sister on me but it still hurts I go along with it and laugh it off but it hurts He s suicidal The only time I ve seen him in two months was for Thanksgiving I m worried he is going to kill myself out of loneliness as he has no one as well and that it would be my fault for not having seen him recently My mom is very nice and cool but for some reason I just hate it when she talks to me I know one reason is because when I do rarely get emotional she talks to other people about it or makes a bigger deal out of it than the situation warrants or tries to pity me which I also hate I don t like it when she knows things about me because she tries to solve it and because again she tells people about it or will use the information to embarrass me at family events which are already tough for me My sister hates me I think Really I think I m a burden on everyone s life in my family but I m trying to avoid platitudes I think she hates me because she always gets pissed when I talk She ll whisper with my mom when I m out of the room about how inconsiderate and lazy I am Recently I came out of my room to the living room to try to socialize with my mom and sister and when I was responding admittedly annoyed by whatever the fuck she was just huffing and puffing and gritting her teeth at my mom as I talked to her and finally my sister said What the fuck is your problem dude To which my mom said Hey no cussing And then my sister said Just talking to my name Implying that any conversation with me will devolve into her cussing at me My mom laughed School is awful I use to have good grades I was in the gifted classes up till middle school Starting getting sad all the time and lonely and my grades began to slip Went to an awful middle school my th grade year and dropped out to go to school online within a quarter of the year The next year I had to transfer over from the high school that would have taken in the middle school I went to and instead to a different school Because of my transfer student status I have to have above a C in everything and less than absences All of this was doable but my depression got worse this year as the year progressed and my grades got worse and worse and my attendance got worse Now I have three D s Two of which can be feasibly increased to a C The point being that I will most likely have to return to my jurisdiction Go to a school where I won t belong and know no one I ll miss her at school I ll get even more depressed I know I ll start to skip I ll have even less emotional support than I do now So I have no one No emotional support No sympathy from others No friends Nothing I ll probably have to move schools which is one of three connections I have to her the other being our jobs we work at the same place and social media texting I lost the one person I ve ever truly cared about and that has ever cared about me and its because of me and I hurt her I m losing passion for the one thing I think I m good at My birthday is in a month and I will have no one to make me happy All this is temporary but it shows a pattern I am mentally ill in some way I will always struggle and I am too cowardly to continue trudging if I am alone Sometimes I fantasize about running away somewhere warm and just dying alone Taking refuge in my own soul Completely unbothered by other people Not expecting the love of others Just knowingly dying by myself I ordered four books on amazon James Joyce by Richard Ellman fairy tales by ee cummings Catcher in the Rye by J D Salinger and Lust for Life by Irving Stone and I m hoping they will all come in before my birthday so I can read them beforehand If not then I will read what I can But I really don t want to keep doing this I don t like it I m not happy I don t think I ever will be nor do I think I deserve it I m just done,"Cause of Distress,

Hey Lar home http i imgur com nD j jpg Your arms were the only ones in which I was truly loved and safe Yeah I get it your own parent not wanting you After you died Mom made it really clear I was a nuisance She left me with pedophiles more than one with me literally begging and screaming for her not to walk out that door while they sat there awaiting the pleasure they d take with me the second she left Even if she was in the next room or taking a quick shower I was the fuckdolly Did you know that one of them was at me for years Yeah he d kill my pets to keep me quiet Another one of her boyfriends Had my childhood dog EB for years he drowned her in the bathtub He killed several Told me Mom would hate me if she ever found out that I had turned him on so much that he had to fuck me until he was completely satisfied Yeah she managed to throw this in my face when she found out jealousy over maternal instinct She s a fucking abusive cunt This was along with all the violent beatings he laid on mom and me not to mention that he kept us indoors and isolated for years aside from the times he was in and out of prison Know how all this came out He knocked me up at the ripe old age of I had to have an abortion He was going to be charged with several things not just for the sexual part but unlawful confinement too Did you know that Mom always treated me like a nuisance even before the pedos telling me that she wished I d never been born screaming Are you fucking retarded if I did something kids normally do such as accidently tipping my juice over at breakfast or took too long doing dishes Enter her violent blowups slaps punches being dragged around by my hair while she screamed visciously Bitch loved to slam her fist between my shoulder blades when I didn t even see it coming I lived in constant fear in childhood I acted out not knowing how to relate to others alienating my peers at school No friends the girl everyone scorned There was no comfort when I was told No one likes you with such vehemence that it still burns in my memory to this day You have no idea how this has isolated me fuck people Not going anywhere near them Isolation is my greatest defence When you have it drilled in your head that you re unwanted it sticks so deeply It burns into the deepest trenches of your being Mom dragged to that fucking tiny hellhole she s from Think that went well You know the one where they re tighter than thieves I was so beaten down and shy of course they took it as me thinking I was better than them I couldn t even look anyone in the eye I was so shy The curled their upper lip when I d pass by I did nothing to deserve this I never hurt any of them I d only wanted to be accepted It didn t help that her next husband tried to convince me I m crazy because I only knew to isolate and couldn t talk to anyone I love my mom no matter what she did and I d call him on his obnoxious behaviour towards her and it made us enemies I hated him deeply as he was a bully and knew she d do anything in her codepent clingy way to keep him He d told me ways of disposing of bodies and not get caught told me he would have killed my mother once if I hadn t walked in the room He d sliced up the mother of his son to the point that he d had served time in a criminal psch ward and arrogantly defended his actions going on about how she deserved it and how much he hated her Whenever he didn t like someone his first comment was that there was something wrong with them in the head Holy fuck pot calling the kettle black or what eh There s can t really be anything truly wrong with me I was just kicked around too much wasn t I Please tell me I m not crazy it s eaten away at me for years I know rationally I m not crazy but this fucking neurotic bullshit eats at me I was truly happy when he died he was evil I d rather have O brien and the other pedophiles than him Fuck everyone thought he was so nice good old uncle rick Piece of motherfucking shit even his corpse is a waste of space Did you know that mom got a lot of money from criminal injuries when you died She was supposed to save it for me but spent it on herself a house and her boyfriends I was lucky to fucking eat or get rags from fucking thrift stores for clothes She still gets cheques each month while your grandkids sit in poverty I took out student loans trying to make something of my self and the debt of it is fucking crushing I nearly finished my degree but trying to make it on my own with the kids too soon after birth nearly killed me Postpartum depression and the stress of it all I ve tried to be strong The kids dad left even before your grandaughter was born I gave birth to her going to university full time and still made the first year winning a scholarship I struggled against depression best I could but I dropped out three times over the years each time summoning stubborn strength to meet the goal of graduating Three strikes I was out No more access to means to finish No jobs to cover tuition loans wiped their hands of me understandably My own stubborn will to try and complete blew up in my face Left with lots of theory and all the pretentious academic terms to describe them but not one practical skill from it all Nonetheless you grandkids You d be so fucking proud of those two hearts of gold and that sparking humour and brains we got from you certainly not her I know you d have spoiled us Mom told us that you really really loved me more than anything you d ever in your life I know that if you were as ga ga over me as you were you d be twice as much over them Nonetheless we struggle I ve been so isolated for most of my life O brien Mom that hellhole she dragged me to settling for the prick of a biological father and more isolation trying to raise the babies in a two bedroom apartment for years not a soul to turn to Not a way to reach out as the isloation eroded any sort of chance to build the means to reach out connect and bond with anyone We re stuck in poverty there s no fucking jobs in this fucking dead end town and even if there were I freeze paralyzed when I try to interact They won I get it I m stupid I m crazy and I m unwelcome I am not allowed to be life if for other people From what Mom tells me you would have have stood before stampedes to protect me I was the apple of your eye you loved me because I was the only thing you ever loved or were loved by Fuck all this shit is just the tip of the iceberg I spoke to your little sister without telling her my intentions and she d be happy to take the kids in case anything happened to me They re better off without me I m so fucking stressed out and scared all the time snarling and isolating from them and everyone else in the world They d be better off with her They re

NSFW Please help meI m and I stayed over my friends house but I stayed downstairs on the sofa because his room is quite small and the sofa would just be comfier I was struggling to sleep because I wasn t that tired and I usually go to bed much later than that in my own house His brother came downstairs I think he s or or something and I could hear him in the kitchen getting a drink or something but then I could hear he came into the dining room bit so he would have been able to see me and he just stayed in the area for a bit and went back into the kitchen He eventually came over to me and I thought he was just getting something from the living room so I just pretended to be asleep but then he said my name really quietly which I just ignored but he said it again so I was thinking what is he doing but still pretended to be asleep because I didn t know what else to do Then he put his hand on my chest and shook me a tiny bit and then went back into the kitchen for something He eventually came back in said my name again and then put his hand under the blanket and on my d ck which was getting hard at this point and idk why because I was nervous and shaking a little bit which I m surprised he didn t notice He was rubbing it a bit and eventually put his hand under my boxers but I turned over onto my side and he went back into the kitchen He was in there for a while doing something idk what he was doing and then he came back in and put his hand down my boxers again but this time my ass because my d ck was facing away from him I didn t know what to do anymore because I couldn t turn the other way again so I had to just let him and he started licking my ass and stuff and I just felt so awkward He went to put his finger up there but that was even worse than him touching my d ck so I just turned back around so I was laying on my back again He didn t even go back into the kitchen this time he just sat on the floor for a bit and then touched my d ck again wanking it and sucking it Then he moved my hand onto his and used my hand to wank his Eventually I came but I didn t enjoy it that much because it was so awkward He kept sucking me off after I had and wanked himself again with my hand until he came too and then he just licked everything up from my belly and went to sleep and I didn t sleep again all night I don t have any parents to tell because they died in a car crash a few years ago and so I just live with my grandad and I know he s someone that would go crazy and make it so awkward for me and I wouldn t be able to see my friend again and he s my closest friend in school My grandad is really ill too so I don t want him to have this as the last experience of his life but I need to tell someone and I didn t know where to post it so I found this page on Google I don t want to ruin my friends life but I haven t been able to sleep much since and can t concentrate on school work at all like I just stare into space mostly in classes and haven t seen my friends in a couple of weeks I ve just been pretending I m busy decorating my bedroom recently but I m just never in the mood to see them anymore I just think my life is ruined and I know it seems like something tiny but my head just doesn t feel like that and I ve been trying to force myself to snap out of it and act normally but it s when I have to focus on things I keep remembering that I m really sorry if this is weird or too much for this page thing I also collapsed in school or fainted or something which I don t know if something to do with this but I was just so tired so I asked to go to the toilet and collapsed in the hallway which a teacher seen and I just said I didn t get much sleep last night because I was playing games and they asked if I was sure and I said yes I m fine and just really warm because it was a warm day too Like idk if this is the right website for this but if you know somewhere else that s fine I m sorry,"Cause of Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Seeking Help",medium

How to help my best friend with her depression suicidal thoughts My roommate is my best friend of almost years and we have lived together for about a year now We have both always struggled with depression but she struggled with suicidal thoughts a lot more than I did and she has been to multiple therapists and has been on medication since she was a teenager She hasn t seen a therapist in over years so she s been on the same low dose Zoloft prescription since then She was also admitted to the hospital on suicide watch when were in high school She has always been very adamant about the fact that she is going to kill herself at some point in her life and how she doesn t care if she dies When we talk about anything related to death car accidents coronavirus murder etc she will bring up how she doesn t care at all if she dies and she welcomes it Today she had about shots and we got into an argument about it because she was saying some concerning things about drinking about how she could drink the whole bottle and she would be fine it was a liter bottle and doesn t care at all if it damaged her organs cus she s gonna die at some point anyways And when I proved to her on the internet that it would kill her she just shrugged and said it s ok if I drink it all it s because I want to die and then I started to get upset and she said don t worry I would never kill myself if you were going to still be alive and be sad about it but if you died or something then I would probably go for it She says that she has just always felt like this and no matter what I say in return she refuses to say anything other than I know my brain and I know that it won t ever change I told her she needs to go back to therapy and even offered to pay for it but she said that she s been to years of therapy and already knows exactly what they ll say so there s no point I told her it s not normal to feel that way for your whole life We argued about it for a while and she just says the same thing over and over and over again I know my brain completely and I know it will never change Over and over it s her only argument I don t know what to do She had an incident a few months ago where she got really really close to attempting suicide and she didn t tell me until the next morning and yet she claims now that if she was at a point where she was thinking about it then of course she would tell me But she didn t before so I don t know what to think Thanks in advance I don t really know what to do,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update",high

I myself have been shot and left for dead over a phone. My family uses me as a scape goat. Everything that goes wrong they yell at me. I cannot go one day without being yelled at made to feel like I am worthless and a mistake. I try reaching out to people but they do not seem to care. As soon as I mention I want to talk about something serious they stop replying. At this point I am just done. I have lost hope. I just cut myself and watching the blood run down my arm was the closest thing to relief I have had. I just want to cut my arm from wrist to end of my arm and just bleed out. The pain feels amazing compared to the mental pain and losing blood feels so good. I think I am ready to go. I have experienced life and it has been nothing but pain and being used.

"Hi there, I am a 23 y/o girl with a single mother who is presumed to have bpd or c-ptsd (suspected by my counsellor). I love her a lot but I just find it endlessly difficult to get along with her as she is very intense. We argue a lot, and there’s nothing wrong with that, but I do hate that one silly argument can result in a week long silent treatment/ resentment in my mother. This period kills me as I love to sort things out soon (no later than a day), say our apologies and move on. After every argument she’ll say something along the lines of “it’s not like we have a good relationship” “I will get back to you to set up new boundaries for our new relationship..” or she’ll threaten to never talk to me again and accuses me of causing her lots of pain. This is why I moved out.
 
 Ive notices that she copies a lot of the things I do and that she is finding herself at the same time I am. There’s nothing wrong with that but it makes me feel icky. She copies the shoes I wear, wants to travel when I do, wants to suddenly move to another area when I’m moving out of home (when she’s never had any of those thoughts growing up). It feels like she sees what I’m doing and compares it to herself. If I wear new pants she says “where are they from? How much? Why don’t I buy myself things like you do?”. I got annoyed the other day when she wanted me to get her the same shoes I wear so I said “mum you have your own identity I’m sure there are lots of other shoes you’d like” and it offended her. She tried to clear this with me on Easter, I apologised and she stopped talking to me and it was awkward as hell. Shes used the line “I’m going to establish new boundaries for our relationship [implying less connection etc”. I know I shouldn’t have questioned her identity but I wish I had a mum who had her own taste and timeline. She’s 53. I hate that she holds resentment for so long. It’s awfully tiring and I can’t sleep. Me and my bf can sort issues out more efficiently and it’s so much healthy.

the next few hours we would be there wondering what was going on Wondering what happens next Wondering if we d be found by the police or the gunman We didn t know he killed himself soon after it started We didn t know if this was some crazy guy or a terrorist attack We didn t know if he was alone But for hours we sat in that room And for hours we would know only the fear of the unknown This was the second time in my life I d been through this The first was in high school My senior year This time however noone would be hurt I have always been thankful for that fact I don t know much of the details of that shooting only what I heard from the people that were in the cafeteria that day What I heard was this A male student angry about a breakup came into school with a gun to kill his ex He got things started by firing into the ceiling of the cafeteria He fired a shot from his semi automatic and gun Then he pulled the slide back and fired into the ceiling again Then he pulled the slide back on more aimed the gun at his ex and pulled the trigger His gun jammed No bullet came out He dropped the gun and ran He made it a few blocks before being tackled to the ground by the French teacher For a long time I ve been thankful that this guy didn t actually know how a handgun was supposed to work I know all this now At the time it was just like when it happened on the job For hours we huddled around the class no idea that it was over No idea that no one had actually been hurt Just the knowledge that someone came into the school and started shooting and the fear that we would be found by a gunman rather than police That fear then only affected me for a few weeks Returning to normal would be a short process then I don t even remember much besides not going to school the next day This time has been different This time the fear has had a profound effect on me that I simply haven t been able to shake I find myself thinking about it all the time Being in that place of fear and ignorance of what would come to pass And the unshakable feeling of worthlessness that comes from feeling this way despite never having been in actual danger I was never in the same room as the gunman in either time I wasn t close enough to even hear the shots But I still fear these events happening again I imagine most people won t ever go through what I ve been through once in there life let alone twice At least not in civilian life But all I can feel is that there will be a third for me It feels like an inevitability that I will find myself in that situation again But I feel like the third will be the last It s given me this sense of an invisible clock on my life One I can feel but not see or read One that says I will be murdered in a random act of violence and not of old age peacefully I m not alone completely though My wife was in that same high school My wife knows the fear of being there wondering what happens next Wondering if anyone got hurt If I got hurt And she knows the fear of wondering if I d make it home that day Sometimes I feel like shes the only one that really gets it I wish this were my only problem The fear soon turned into depression Depression is something I know I m familiar with the desire to simple stop existing I know the pain that comes from wishing to God that life would just end for me so that my loved ones could cope with my loss rather than my commitment The shame of these thoughts is something that I ve dealt with on and off for a decade now What s new to me is this horrifying feeling of rage and hatred that the depression seems to have manifested into I hate every single human alive right now Myself more than any I hate myself for the hatred that I feel towards you reading this right now The hatred I feel towards my neighbors and co workers Toward my own family These are the feelings that scare me more than anything I feel them every night as I try to sleep These horrifying thoughts make it difficult to sleep I ve never been an angry person But now it s something that I feel so much of I m losing sleep over it and I feel that s making things so much worse The last issue I m going to mention is a drug I m taking It s a drug called methotrexate I started taking it in December It has some pretty bad side effects for some people Some people take it with very little side effect I take the drug once a week on Saturdays When I take the drug I feel nausea abdominal pain head aches and ridiculous levels of fatigue I usually sleep around hours on Saturday because of the fatigue I think beyond these the drug may be affecting me psychologically I don t know how to verify besides by not taking the drug today If that s all I have to do to go back to normal then that s what I ll do I m just scared that won t be enough I started therapy in January He was quick to diagnose PTSD but no method of treatment has been offered yet I know these things take time though He also recommended coming off the medication After writing all this I don t even know what to expect people to say Generic Just hang in there bro I don t know Maybe some one else I can talk to would be helpful I feel a little better having written all this out like I could go to sleep without rage I scare myself lately In this moment I don t want to hurt anyone I feel like I should take myself out while I m like this so I don t hurt anyone else I m scared of getting locked away in a ward too The loss of wages alone would be devastating I don t think anything good would come of that I don t want to put my wife through that I just want help I m scared of help but I know that s what I need I just don t know where to really get it from I m so scared of you reading this finding out who I am and reporting me as dangerous That my life will be ruined because I sought help But I can t let fear stop me or I will die and it may not be alone It s that simple But I m still so scared right now,"Cause of Distress, Mental Distress,

My life as it is so far I m currently yrs old and living in the UK I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety disorders late I ll try to be brief yet thorough in this post I grew up a single child with a hostile violent farther and a neurotic drug addict mother from ages around I m remember being taken to addicts houses where they would chase the dragon or even worse public toilets it didn t bother me much then as it was the norm for me My farthers violence was ironicly the cause of my mums drug abuse When I was she left and was put in a mental hospital Which in return was a good thing because she was free of him I however was not I won t tell each incident he beat me as too many one for instance me and my father were playing ps tenchu game and I had beaten him a few times on multiplayer he lost his rag and smashed a China cup on my face As time went by I got used to treading on egg shells until I was about and met my first gf which he was totally against By the time I was and could fight back he decided to kick me out on Christmas day from then I was homeless for approx years until I turned and have been working full time since The most disheartening reality is that my mother is in an awful situation she s drug free But has paranoid phycosis osteoporosis and hep c I haven t spoke with my father for years and my mum is so depressed she keeps talking about taking an OD of heroine before her hep is terminal and the worst part is I can completely sympathize with her but the whole reality of my life gets me extremely upset and makes me want to end it as all the future holds for certain is unbearable My mum is currently paying off her funeral plans and is all she seems to talk about no real care for how any of this maybe effecting me but I keep thinking to myself I ve dealt with this shit all my life surely it should get easier I ve had CAT theorpy counseling meds the lot None work Please if anyone has any helpful suggestions please speak up Thanks,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update, Seeking Help",high

I don t know who I am anymoreThat s where I m at right now as I write this I ve been depressed for years now but the depression this time is different stronger I don t really feel down I just feel empty drained of everything that was ever considered me I rarely feel anything anymore or at least I no longer know how or what to feel Things I used to enjoy I can no longer stand or no longer get any pleasure out of I have no motivation to do anything other than sleep and I only do things because I m obligated to My personality is gone as well and the feelings I ve had for those close to me are no longer there When I call my dad or mom I feel nothing I don t feel like myself anymore and I have no idea who I am anymore I just feel like a ghost crudely occupying and controlling a fleshy shell I mean there are times when my legs or my hands don t feel like mine My cognitive ability is completely shot as well and I can barely remember things more than a day s past Just typing this is an ordeal constant spelling mistakes and typos On top of all this I have no one to talk to I have no friends to talk to Sure my Facebook profile says otherwise but I never talk to any of them online let alone IRL I can t even tell my family because I know all they ll do is worry and try to fruitlessly help I mean I sometimes go so long without talking to someone that I will forget how to speak properly even with people I know quite well I wish I had someone I could talk to on a regular basis but I ve realized this will never happen because I always end driving people away for one reason another be it my personality and mannerisms or just because they found something better Some say a therapist or counselor might help but they never have for me The problem is myself I m physically repulsive I ve seen the way people look at me and the way they behave around me I mean who wants to be seen talking to a fat greasy pizza faced creeper stache monster with a sweat problem Even if they can get past that outer shell what they find isn t any better I m a dull person The things that interest me typically don t interest others and vice versa My personality and interests just aren t compatible with most people And even with people that share the same interests I usually end up screwing things up by doing something stupid or something about me drives them away And for those that are close to me I feel like an inconvenience Maybe not so much a burden but just one of those people where others go Oh here comes THAT guy again Quick let s think of a reason not to hang out with him FFS I even feel this way with complete strangers When I m crossing the road buying groceries riding the bus or just simply standing around I just get this sense that people wish I weren t there That if I weren t their day would be better I m also an addict or rather becoming one For years I was addicted to sleeping pills and benzos anything that would knock me out and numb the mental pain Then I was diagnosed with HPPD and I stopped for awhile Then I became addicted to benzos again and I started drinking I managed to kick those for a few months but now I m back at it Every night I find myself drinking or experimenting with some new benzo Anyways I feel like I m rambling a bit I guess if anything could stop me from doing what I m planning on doing it would be if I could have myself back and someone close to talk to I want the old me back the me that had friends and enjoyed things like playing guitar or staying up until am to figure out a bug in some code And I wish I had someone I could talk to about how I feel Because I don t have someone to talk to I just keep things in and never let them out and I think I finally broke whatever was inside of me by doing so Some might say get a therapist but I ve tried in the past and it just doesn t feel genuine enough I need a friend not a therapist Some might also say to call up some old buddies from high school but again I feel like I m such an inconvenience to them Anyways come Wednesday night I have some things I need to take care of on Monday and Tuesday some final preparations I ll finally be done with this It s not that I m in any sort of emotional or psychological pain it s just that I m tired of not feeling tired of feeling like an empty shell Unless a miracle happens between now and then there s no stopping me now I ve gathered my materials and made my preparations I m just putting this here because I felt like I should at least get these things off my chest,"Cause of Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Progress Update",medium

Desperate desolate and depressed Xpost from r depression I m unsure if this is the right space to post it but let me just start by saying that just a few days I thought of ending my life I know what I m going to do and how I m going to do it so that it will end quickly I don t know what I m seeking for here Money Advice Words of encouragement I really don t know Perhaps anything Perhaps nothing First official depression prognosis started since high school from bullying in Internalised homosexual tendencies Pre college studies affected delayed by a year sexually assualted when doing national service where I was Kept quiet because I m a guy and it was by another man Got properly diagnosed with general and social anxiety disorder It happened too long ago but scarred me deeply I kept quiet and just kept it in Travelled alone for a bit and was okay but university came and felt like I was in the wrong place Had multiple leaves of absences because I wasn t coping Met some friends for life who kept me alive met more than didn t stay However accummulated a high amount of student loan because of this Currently on hiatus from university even when I just turned weeks ago Met the man of my life in university went through years and a lot of shit together He was my beacon and support for the longest time However this guy left me because he felt like I wasn t going anywhere which was because of inaction or lack of achievements caused by my depression and he lost feelings for me He was unable to empathize with my depression because of the way he was brought up and saw it as laziness or just plain wasting my life away He broke up with me late november in and I m still not over him This experience still has a leading impact on my mental stability I ended up doing many stupid things after some while heavily intoxicated and I can say for certain that I sabotaged any lingering bridges between the both of us He s not a bad person Family are not supportive of my sexual identity As an asian family there were high hopes and expectations on studies and success Also we were mid low class and we don t have much financial sustainability My parents they are not bad people They work hard but they are not highly educated I had to learn a lot of things on my own I have been supporting myself for the longest time even if I still stay with my parents We don t communicate much the times we do are usually very abrasive and I feel mostly isolated and alone Found my passion for the arts and drive in the media broadcast tv industry through several career opportunities in the forms of external ad hoc internships during the times when I was looking for something to do while on leave of absences However the lack of an official paper qualifications led them all going nowhere The last stint ended in end of April when Covid got serious and I was let go because I was expendable Ultimately much experience but very little income and with my age I m unable to compete for entry level jobs with fresh graduates with the right qualifications Besides I have a lot of debts and no money to start another diploma or degree elsewhere which is something at the back of my mind but never able to achieve I have maybe k usd to my name in terms of expendable cash It has been roughly months since I m unemployed and not doing anything and while I m still on hiatus from university I have to decide by the end of the year if I was to continue or terminate my matriculation I m in my final year but I m severely tormented with the idea of forcing myself through for something that I am not wishing to do in the future and that it will take a further toll on my mental health But if I leave it would be years and money wasted I have Right now I m juggling between part time work but even those are scarce and few heavily strenous and I feel like it s not enriching I ve been sending out resumes and applications but always met with rejection I tried seeking remote jobs as well like ways to sustain making money online but always hitting a wall I m basically powering through just to earn some money to sustain myself and it has been a struggle everyday I never thought I was unintelligent but I think my low level of confidence my inferiority complex abandonment issues with the breakup isolation from my family my financial burdens and the hopelessness of not being able to go anywhere in life with so much potential has caused me a lot of mental anguish I struggle with sleep everyday and I wake up everyday feeling worse wishing I did better I d like to think if I was given another opportunity or more resources in life I will have done much better and to never fall into this state Alas everything is always better in hindsight It s easy to say that you re comparing oranges to apples but when I look at my peers or close friends around me most if not all of them are in a better place than me Maybe they were born in a better environment maybe they have met supportive people in their lives maybe they all chose wiser with what they wanted to do in life and here I am feeling stuck and incredously bopeless I know there is definitely someone out there who has it worse off than me but the darkness is so overpowering that I do not know how to continue with life I wonder everyday when is the day I will finally have the courage to choose to go so that I can relieve myself from this pain I m not okay I wonder if you reading this have any resources or pearls of wisdom for me,"Cause of Distress, Mental Distress, Progress Update, Seeking

I am sick of tryingI really don t know why I bother anymore My birthday was yesterday and it really just solidified the idea that I don t matter at all not even a little bit I always always help through fun birthday parties for people ever since I ve moved ive helped throw and organize one was even a surprise party I put lots of money and effort into these parties Its not like I did this to expect anything back its not that its just sad when people just dont care Not one of my close friends posted on my fb which its just like such an easy thing Everyone is on fb everyone sees the birthday notification but they chose to not even say a word I know this sounds so stupid and whiney but its just like solidifies the idea that i dont matter I never ever did to my friends And its not them its me I dont deserve to be cared about im the annoying person that hangs around them and they deal with it and i appreciate that they do but why should I even bother them anymore theyd be so better off without me My mother could literally care less that I exist she is coming home for Christmas and posted a status about how she was so excited to see her mother her sister in law and her niece Not a word about me or my sister She knew wed see it obviously if we have her on fb Not even the person who gave birth to me can remember i exist All I am good for is being used occasionally I am not worth the air I breath I just take up space and time that other people could be using I am ugly and fat and everyone knows it I can tell people are disgusted by me and im so sorry that they even have to look at me I wish I would just disappear people would only notice because I have duties like getting the bills ready to pay My other friend was having a rough time and everyone rushed to her side to help her to be there for her But no one cares about me maybe because i have felt bad on and off for so long maybe because im disgusting and dont matter maybe everyone is secretly hoping ill kill myself so they can stop being annoyed by me the only thing that keeps me here is my pet and i mean how sad is that That the only thing that needs me is my pet because he has to because i have to take care of him I just dont want to try anymore im so sick of trying and im so sick of not mattering I know it sounds all so stupid but everyone of my friends all care and love each other so much but when it comes to me im just nothing I dont want to leave bed or my room i just want to eat junk food until i cant move and just rot away Im so digusting and unattractive no one will ever love me ill be alone forever no one will ever care so why dont i just fucking end it get it over with what the point on sticking around there is none I want to end my life so bad i feel like looking up suicide methods is so so comforting because its like i know there is a way to escape I know i am stupid and people hate me because i have no reason to feel this way but it only makes me want to end it more There is no help I can get ive done it all Why bother i just dont want to take up space and peoples time anymore i hate being a burden I just dont want this anymore i want my friends to be happy and have a good life and they dont deserve someone who is disgusting and a nuisance in their life,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk",high

and wanting to dieFor as long as I can remember I ve been angsty but when I was perpetually suicidal for about a year up until a few months ago I thought I had clinical depression I was also having some hallucinations from the stress I got put on some medications and eventually felt better Now I m feeling that way again and I m wondering if maybe this is just how I naturally feel I recently found out I have Asperger s and I know a lot of aspies have constant battles with depression I ve sort of being trying to deny it to myself but every day it is clear that I can t stand life I recently got a job and I think that has made it all worse I was previously a highschool dropout and I spent most of my time in bed and visiting depression support forums People say that once you start doing things you ll feel better but for me doing things just creates things that overwhelm me I have to go to school one day a week for this job I ve got and I m looking through this logbook thing I have to fill out and I know that I just don t give a fuck about it I have no aspirations to succeed I just want to be happy but happiness is nebulously defined for me and I think that s because it isn t possible My mother doesn t know I m suicidal again although I have spoken of how I d like to quit this job and the school My father recently died and she doesn t want me to quit the job because she says we need income She says she doesn t think we could get benefits for me even though I m diagnosed with autism That may just be her trying to coax me into staying though Either way I can t help but feeling my family would simply be better off without me in the long run I am ultimately just a drain on precious resources and I don t care to be here I think the only thing that has stopped me from killing myself is the fear that it wouldn t work Maybe it will get better but I really can t see how and if I was dead it wouldn t matter if it could have gotten better I wouldn t have any conception of it If I had a pill that was certain to kill me right now I know I would just take it I think if I try to kill myself it will probably just be cutting my wrists because knives are easily accessible I know that usually doesn t work but I d go the whole hog and make sure it was deep and long and down the underside of my forearm I m really scared to do that though because if it doesn t work my arm and hand will be thoroughly fucked up I just don t see any reason for me to stick around I wouldn t say I really enjoy anything and life is just a big ball of stress for me I found out recently that a friend I used to have on one of the depression support forums tried to kill herself and it s making me feel like if she can do it then I can do it Hopefully I would succeed and if not at least I wouldn t be expected to work or succeed anymore,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update",high

My friends betrayed me this happened years ago when I was One of my best friends threw a kickback at his pad It was his birthday Me and my three other close friends meet up about an hour before the party starts to help my friend setup We have beer liquor and we are all set A few people show up and we re just chillin having a few beers A couple shots of jack and time starts to fly Its now close to midnight and or so more people show up This is where it kicks off I can see some people are completely hammered and everyone serving up shots More people start to show up that we don t know and at this point im about beers and shots in My friend goes to the liquor store and come back with a few bottles of jameson This is where I blackout soon I keep pounding back more shots and I ve lost count Next thing you know it s am and everyones left except for our group of friends I m not feeling too good and go to sit down on the couch to try and rest As soon as i sit down i start to puke Luckily Someone next to me was puking earlier and they had a bucket and handed it to me The host gets upset and doesnt want anyone puking inside his house So im blacked out and I cant move so they try to carry me outside to the backyard I was too heavy so they drag my body on the floor and try to get me outside Now im faced down in the grass unable to move but still conscious One of my friends lifts my shirt up takes his belt off and starts to whip my back He s drunk and starts lashing at me nonstop for awhile The other guys then come outside to see what s going on They just stand around me laughing with him and don t stop him or say anything This went on for about an hour or so I am in so much pain I cant move my body or defend myself All I could do was yell and scream After awhile they see im not moving or saying anything and they think im dead So all four of them carry me into a car and throw me in a dumpster I remember being carried into a car and then waking up in a dumpster all bruised scarred and feeling like shit I can t believe my friends have done this to me These are people I loved stood up for and trusted I cut them off after that day and never spoke to them again I have never told anyone this I ve been keeping this inside and I occasionally get nightmares and flashbacks of that night I have developed trust issues with everyone after this and its really hard for me to make new friends I guess i ve been traumatized,"Cause of Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Mental Distress, Seeking Help",medium

Paranoia controlled lifeFor the past three years I have been suffering from an extremely strange twist on my reality I still have not been able to explain well to others what exactly is going on in my head because even I don t fully understand I will start from the beginning with my best attempt to summarize the problem When I was I was self medicating with weed and alcohol on a daily basis There s no doubt in my mind that smoking pot plagued me with a lasting paranoia beyond the initial high or trip Say what you want about weed but the fact about it is that it can be very dangerous for some people It shattered my self esteem and I still feel like I am in constant danger At this same point in my life I was very isolated and depressed The most regretful part about this time is that I was self loathing and didn t realize how much opportunity around me there was to make positive changes In other words I was being a bitch about the life I had I am a lot better about this now and have no problem displaying positivity in front of others when I have the chance to do it I freeze up with nervousness in some social situations but I kicked the tendency to try to look sad for sympathy The subject of looking upset in front of others was not a completely new thing either Even as a little kid and teenager people would say to me things like what s wrong you look sad or you look like you are in physical pain what is going on or you need to smile more Also I have always had red watery eyes This led people to believe that I was stoned all the time even though I had never even seen weed until I started college I say this to explain that others have seen sadness or seriousness on my face when I am not trying to send off that energy and to transition into the beginning of the traumatic part At the job I had when I was self loathing I was purposefully looking down enough to the point where my coworkers thought I was actually crying I wasn t actually spilling tears because I had to work and didn t want to but I was figuratively crying about my life at work in front of others It took me awhile to figure out that people came to this conclusion but when I did I quit If I could choose a saying to apply to this it is definitely you got what you wished for I wanted people to see that I was sad and I got that in a way that was humiliating I was happy to be at work I really liked that job I had perfect attendance and took pride in my position with nerdiness Realizing that people thought I was crying over having to work made me panic to the point of having to hold back tears I let the opinion of others take control of me The next job I started was bussing tables I went into this job care free ready to forget my previous experience of regret and embarrassment I had already started to make an effort to act uplifted when I started working here Even when I felt comfortable and believed that I had picked a good gig because the restaurant speed and environment was enjoyable people thought I was crying over the work I swear I would feel totally calm and ask a customer if I could take a plate and they would be holding back laughter refusing to make eye contact with me When I realized this I became so self conscious about the way my face looked that almost every time a customer would ask me something I would feel like I was about to cry My face would twitch and my lip would quiver I never had tears streaming down my face at work but I would be on the verge of tears from the paranoia and panic This was an even more humiliating work experience for me because the public was there to witness and the town began to talk My reputation was completely stained with pathetic stories This same thing repeated with three jobs after this one After over three years since the problem first appeared there have been brighter times from then until now where the problem has not been fully surfaced in my every day life like it is now But it always creeps back in and pulls me down I still can not figure out if I looked so anxious and depressed that the appearance of my watery eyes led people to believe that I was crying What I do know is that I allowed it to push me over and become a reality Now it completely controls my life If I just talk to someone face to face it makes me want to cry Imagine just having someone ask you directions to a train station and becoming so overwhelmed with self consciousness that you begin to shake and tremble with a face about to weep When I walk down the street I feel like everyone will look at me and think I am crying So I always feel like I am about to do so It s not to the point of tears streaming down my face in public but it s everything that starts before that when anyone cries It s a cringed face quivering lower lip trembling etc I now live in NYC and just walking down the street is a horror Everyone on my street recognizes me as the young guy who you can see trying not to cry The delusional thoughts I have create the reality I can t think of anything more embarrassing for a twenty two year old male to be going through I am only still living because of the fear of hurting family and friends I would leave behind I think about jumping in front of the train a lot I go to a therapist once a week have tried multiple anxiety and depression medications currently tapering off Lamictal which makes everything a hell of a lot worse and the only thing that really helps are benzodiazepines Smoking weed definitely exaggerated panic in me and I believe this is why I am easily overcome with fear when people look at me A lot of the thoughts that would float through my brain during stoned contemplation would be self critical so I believe that those thoughts created an immense negative view of myself that I wrongly presumed people saw too It has been over two years since I bought weed but I have accepted hits every now and then Now I will completely refuse it because of the state of my brain To make matters worse I have used cocaine a little bit It was never an addiction but just an unhealthy choice I made several times which obviously did not help with paranoia Before I started getting high I was a bright kid and handled conflict well with my first job I knew how to handle customers yelling at me I would appreciate any stories of overcoming serious paranoia or advice on treatments that I may not know about I am trying to find some kind of practical coping method Thanks for reading a post this long edit I am new to reddit so any subs you think I should transfer this to would be appreciated,"Cause of Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help",medium

The worst part is I have no emotions for others during this time so I find myself being more ok with ending it all. I feel halfway to death is the best way to describe it.

I m going to be meeting with a friend in eight hours but I m not sure I can pretend today I ve been doing well but have had a small relapse of sleep deprived madness the past few days I m not being hyperbolic either you would be appalled at how I have been conducting myself in private Usually when we hang out it brings me such joy and I can match the energy I am kind and friendly in the most genuine ways but I deliberately avoid showing even the slightest sign that anything is wrong Why Because she s a girl That reasoning might make you upset That s fair honestly I ve just found that on a subconcious level girls will only tolerate negative emotion from other girls There s probably other factors at work of course and I desperately want to be wrong but Gathering more evidence isn t worth the risk But it seems like that will happen today anyway She will know something is wrong and perhaps she will ask No matter how much I refuse it is inevitable I will let something slip She s a very smart girl so it s decently likely she may be aware of her instincts and be able to compensate for them but again I don t want to take that risk At any moment she could cut off contact badmouth me to mutual acquaintances and disappear She knows where I live but the same can t be said for the reverse She must never find out how lonely I am must never find out she is my only true friend must never find out how desperately I need a literal shoulder to cry on I want to be vulnerable but I have too much to lose,"Cause of Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Mental Distress",medium

Just need some mental help here Not sure how to go on So i ve dealt with depression for a very long time Nothing too severe the majority of the time but sometimes it just spikes and I get happy at the thought of not having to deal with Life You know I got laid off at the beginning of december after having a shitty paycheck for taking a week off due to being sick and as you can imagine I ve run out of money I ve had in my bank account for around a week and a half now after having to pay for a traffic ticket that wasn t really my fault That s what they all say and I m living off of one box of brown rice I found in the back of my pantry I thought I had found a job that could get me through until I found a real one and I was elated but it turned out to basically be a scam I ve made a grand total of for hours of work and I wont even be getting that for another week So you can imagine going from elated to absolutely crushed has ruined me both mentally and physically I don t think I left my room today other than going to the bathroom It s and I haven t even had a drink today And to top all of this off Apparently Hulu can overdraft my bank account even though I told chase when explicitly asked to NEVER let my account be overdrawn So now my bank balance is And I ll be charged a fee for that which I wont be able to pay because I ve only made dollars So there s another fee on top because of that that I won t be able to pay And on and on and on Added to this the fact that if I want a real job at any point in the near future I need to go through college getting myself further into debt even though I don t even know what I want to do for a career anymore I just don t see the actual point of being alive when all I am is unhappy or happy but waiting for a problem to present itself What do Help,"Cause of Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Mental Distress",medium

"Hi all! I've been on this sub before, but I left a while back because of the whole, y'know, denial thing that anything is actually wrong and putting blinders on. You know how it is.
 
 I've been a total piece of crap to my husband, who has been my biggest champion for YEARS. I've allowed myself to be a total slave to my illness and basically refused to do anything to better myself. I didn't feel that I needed it, but holy shit I do. On top of that, I've discovered that while not diagnosed, I do actually fit the NPD criteria. Not fun in. The. SLIGHTEST. But it really explains a LOT and knowing about narcissistic rage answers a lot of questions, which helps.
 
 I've lost all of my friends and family and while my husband still loves me and cares for me, he is so hurt by everything I've put him through. I am at a crossroads in my life: I either keep putting fingers in my ears and insisting that I don't need to change, and thus getting divorced and being completely alone, *or*, I can make the damn changes, make amends, and have the family, friends, and husband I love, want, and need.
 
 It's time to make my indecisive ass choose something for once.
 
 For those of you who have successes and have been able to make amends in damaged relationships, and have made changes in yourself; what are some ways I can be better about my illness and more aware of the effect I have without hiding from it? How can I be a better person for the people who love me dearly, but are very tired and hurt?

Cold empty alone I m currently sitting in my room after a particularly horrible moment with my mother and don t know what else to do You probably already know what I want to do I don t even know why I m here Just turning to the one place I know Reddit Sorry for any mistakes my eyes are leaking I know no one cares about any type of backstory or even me but I guess I should give a bit more background to make myself seem a little less like the shitty teenager you ll think I am But first of all what sparked this particular fight if I can even call it that was I was just having a generally shitty day Felt nauseous all day for some reason my mother drove over a curb which caused the pizza we had just bought to spill onto my brand new white shirt plus my mom has just been rude all day to me to strangers It s just your typical annoying day I was annoyed and you could tell Wasn t really speaking much but when I did I was short with her and bitter This annoyed her and I knew that but I couldn t make myself cheery Right before our fight I was telling her about Juice WRLD and how sad it was I had already mentioned his passing earlier but I m a big fan of someone he had collaborated with didn t know they had collaborated until that moment and was explaining to her how they apparently collaborated During saying this she was nodding her head and acting like she was listening but apparently she wasn t She started coughing a few moments after I was finished speaking and said I was choking the entire time you were talking Thanks for noticing and caring Really means a lot Now if I had noticed she was choking I would ve immediately helped her I m not that horrible When speaking to her I was looking directly at her and she was nodding the entire time and didn t seem in distress whatsoever I was confused and told her this but she said she was making it obvious but couldn t tell me she was choking since she couldn t breathe and was coughing I pointed out she didn t cough until after I finished speaking but she just said I was wrong I let it go because I don t want to argue so I just go back to browsing Reddit She asked me now what did you say and I just told her to forget about it it didn t matter This is where everything went horribly She persisted come on tell me Now I ll admit I yelled at her Everything was boiling right under the surface and I just couldn t keep calm anymore She proceeds to tell me she heard me mention Juice WRLD and my favorite band but she didn t know why I told her then she must ve heard me This is when she decides to push my buttons She starts saying how I m just the happiest little girl she s ever met I m almost how I m a ray of sunshine and SUCH a good daughter and she s laughing this entire time I m ignoring her because she does this all the time looking for a reaction and I don t want to give her the satisfaction This is when she mentions how I need happy pills and she doesn t know what type of pills that would be but I need some kind of pill she didn t mean antidepressants This seemed incredibly insensitive to me as I was just speaking to her about Juice WRLD and of course so many people are thinking his death is caused from drug use She knew what she was doing I ll admit I said something really disgusting I said good maybe they ll kill me so I can finally die She s known about my suicidal thoughts since August of this year and didn t much care when she found out She actually found out because I had told my sister about some notes journal type things I had written to help me cope She confronted me like I was in trouble saying we need to talk and you know exactly what you ve done She didn t do anything except threaten me with making me go to a hospital and sent me to my room I ve brought it up one other time on Thanksgiving after a huge family fight saying May I had a handful of pills ready to go and didn t do it She made this about herself saying how she must be a terrible mother I just ignore it at this point After I said maybe the nonexistent happy pills she s speaking about would kill me she started going off She said I have no business acting like my life is so horrible how I have the easiest life in the world how other people my age have school jobs and even kids and how she doesn t make me do anything and hands me everything on a silver platter I ll get to why this really hurt me later But she just kept saying that I shouldn t act like she s the worst person in the world because she s the best mom I ve got she says this every single time me or my sibling is upset with her and I stayed silent the entire time I was crying but silent She knows why I struggle with living but doesn t care She dropped me off at our shared home and left She has actually came back home as I was writing this I m currently locked in a bathroom A big reason as to why I struggle with living is because of chronic illness For probably years I ve been sick I genuinely don t remember what it feels like to not feel pain It started with a rare condition which was causing me to vomit every day of my year old life and I started to lose my vision Took a year before they figured out what it was but i was on medication for a long time spinal taps every couple months before I finally had brain surgery in A few months after the surgery I had a fever every single day of August It took a while before they discovered what it was IBD Not many people without IBD know how much it sucks and I m sure my experience is unlike other people suffering with IBD but when I say my IBD has ruined my life I mean it I haven t been in remission once since fall I ve been close but there has always been something wrong My GI office that I stuck with from beginning to summer of this year also didn t help much as I found out I had been on medication I shouldn t have been steroids for years which has also made my life a living hell I have since been diagnosed with cushing s syndrome because of the steroid use I also have fibromyalgia osteopenia and gastroparesis Things were bad May since I had that handful of pills but that summer I was started on chemotherapy and it genuinely ruined my life I don t know if my reaction was normal but after a couple doses my days started blending together It s hard to describe but it felt like my average day was maybe an hour or two long During this time I felt absolutely zero emotion I felt nothing I just remember wishing I could feel again Crying and being upset hurts but being physically unable to feel nothing being completely and utterly numb is so much worse I really could not feel And I thought it would get better after I was off of it but I didn t for a long time I was so numb and so scared I m still not back to what I was before The only way I can describe how I feel is like I m in this super deep dark hole I m completely alone it s freezing cold and all my senses have been ripped from me All I feel is so scared I m always scared I have nightmares every single night about my worst fears and I have flashbacks about different procedures Sometimes I ll be sitting doing nothing and feel like a feeding tube is being forced down my nose I know it s not really happening but I get so scared A lot of traumatic things have happened to me and my doctors and mom make me feel like I m being a baby about it I ve never sought help for any of these mental issues because I know I won t be happy or okay til I m normal Not sick Not in pain For my mom to tell me I have the easiest life in the world really hurts I am in misery I keep trying to claw myself out of where I m at and recently I ve been happy Or I thought I was But last night I felt a little strange and then today this all happens and I realize I was never happy i was just trying to pretend I was I m exhausted I m tired I m having a hard time breathing and I just want it all to be over I don t want to be alive but I can t make myself kill myself I m a coward I pray every night that I won t wake up the next day so when I roll over and see the sun through my blinds see the posters on my walls and feel that I m still here I m upset The one thing I want won t happen unless I do it myself And I can t bring myself to do it no matter how hard I try What makes it so much worse is my grandmother dad s side called me while I was writing this She brought up how our entire family has been depressed and how she felt like she was in a fog She told me this while I m ranting about wanting to die How cruel is that Even worse my grandfather wanted to talk to me He is the only father figure I ve ever known the only man I ve ever trusted and loved and my light and purpose He is the only person to ever fully love me His love is unfaltering and he s always been here for me I had to give short responses because I was sobbing but I m really good at hiding it now so I don t think he noticed And then he told me he loves me so much and to please take care of myself He told me he loved me again I broke I think he might ve heard me but I don t know I needed that so badly but the worst part is it isn t changing my mind I still want to die How can I be so cruel and selfish That s disgusting of me I don t even know if I want to send this now But I just don t know what to do Want to die but can t do it Coward Don t really want help but here I am anyway I just want someone to acknowledge me and understand I want someone out there to understand why I want this and understand me I want someone to know I exist as well I don t have any friends and few family that speaks to me My mom is the only person that really talks to me I dropped out of high school a while ago because of teachers claiming I was faking my illnesses and I can t get a job because my immune system is so weak I ve had a cold for a month now And I am a complete loser I might sleep now Actually sleep not die Still too much of a coward to do that I doubt anyone will read this but it feels good to be able

 I lied to my partner Thursday, I believe I had a BPD episode and he doesn’t. Even if he doesn’t, it’s my fault, I’m no longer taking my meds or going to therapy. 
 
 On Thursday I made up a lie. About my partner’s ex whom he keeps in contact with (but we both keep in contact with our exs- nbd) I said a lot of crazy shit— I received a “text” message from someone who knows her and said they (his ex and him) would ultimately be together in the end, that he is using me, that he wants to be with her, and that he is deleting messages between them to because I have gone through his phone in the past, that I was crazy.
 
 I don’t know why I lied to that extreme, I just know that it was fucked up which is why I’m seeking accountability. 
 
 What does accountability look like for someone with BPD, I know I lied, I know I’m not on my meds I know I am not going to therapy. 
 
 When he confronted me about the lie on Friday I realized I had spilt it was all black and white thinking in my head. He loved and missed his ex and hated and wanted nothing todo with me. As I’m writing this I realize it isn’t the reality of things but I still acted out. And I need to be held accountable for my actions. I don’t want to lose the love of my life. 
 
 After he left the apartment to clear his head I began to cut because I needed to release all my emotions and built up anxiety. As I was looking at the blood fall I knew I had to seek help I didn’t want this to be the last feeling I felt. 
 
 I have my psychiatrist appointment the 19th at 10:30 am — wish me luck 🍀. 
 
 My question is, what does accountability look like when you hurt your FP?","Cause of Distress, Progress Update, Seeking Help",medium

What the fuck did I just drink I was at a private party people I knew everyone there We bought some beers bottle of wiskey brandy and some energy drinks Later in the night we ran out of drinks and my friend s gf suggested she can bring out a bit of homemade stuff that her mom makes from her basement We agreed and she brought something that she claimed had alchohol It was like drinking fire but realy easy to down nice flavour and I didn t even need to drink something like cola to down it more easily Got me fucked up in few mins Realy strong clean alchohol high Me and my gf were the only ones who drank it she did shot and I did Next day I had visual audio and sensory halucionations on the bottomn corners of my FOV I saw realy detailed smoke every time I exhaled and when I closed my eyes I could hear my gf breathing in my face and even saying something just like in that moment when we drank this stuff I thought it was just me and didn t tell anyone but later I saw on my gf s insta story that she had absolutely same things going on smoke everywhere and she kept feeling my breath on her face I am realy weirded out Has anyone heared of a halucionations from alchohol We both were on alchohol nicotine caffeine and sleep deprived for h when this happened but real weird that we had the same effects Even today I can barely see a small haze on my FOV when I look for it What the fuck,"Cause of Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Seeking Help",medium
So yeah. Is this normal? I read ab BPD and I have like every sign and like all the traumas that cause it too. But also I’m j anxious and depressed and adhd and ptsd and then also mild paranoia and dissociation so idkkk. But when I read these posts they resonate w me like more than anything else. I went to therapy just cus people told me to and it was awful. Later learned my therapist was a duck but he pretty much told me that me being positive was me being fake and then I spiraled down into like binge eating bc I couldn’t dissociate anymore after therapy. ‘‘Twas bad. He sort of was saying that me having a positive and bubbly personality was all a show tho. But like now I don’t think so like underneath was just nothing so I sort of just turned into this depressed fat person. Now I’m healthy again but it’s just hard feeling things cus I used to be able to dissociate from all feelings. But idek if I have BPD.,Miscellaneous,low

Really need someone to talk to I ve had social anxiety ever since I decided to go to a different school than all the people I grew up with during the transition from elementary school to high school During the early years in my life up to grade I wasn t socially anxious at all in fact I was always the one to make people laugh and put on a show didn t mind the spotlight The only problem was these people I never really felt like I fit in with the people I grew up with I d get invited out occasionally but I never really fit it so I decided to start over by going to a different high school This would be the worst decision of my life During my two years there I was paralyzed with anxiety made one friend and began to get depressed While everyone was out enjoying life and hanging out with friends I was glued to the computer getting lost in video games as an escape from reality I would play every second I had and I feel that s what lead me to develop an anxiety disorder Oddly enough I still had no problem going to and from class or walking alone in public or anything of that nature That was years ago I m now and have been through a lot since then After being diagnosed back in I was on various drugs most of them didn t work except for one cipralex For one whole year cipralex had effectively convinced me that my socially anxious days were over I could finally be that person I d always wanted to I always knew that I had that person in me but the anxiety was preventing me from being that person After a year of feeling on top of the world the medication started to lose it s effect and I slowly spiraled downward I was pretty bummed at this point I started reading up on social anxiety on the internet I wanted to know how it worked once I knew that I could surely put an end to it over time This is when I learned about cognitive behavioral therapy I originally got a book by David D Burns to overcome my anxiety but quit half way through I ended up living with the fact that I was anxious for a few years but back in December of I came across an audio series on overcoming social anxiety The series required you to listed to a tape each week and read over the handouts for that session every day And I was faithful I d read way past the recommended minutes a day often To be perfectly honest I now know more about SA than I have in my life and I m currently still on the program a little over half way through and being faithful I ve put many of the strategies and methods learned into every day life and have had some success I ve been able to calm myself down at times and focus more externally by rationalizing my irrational thinking and taking them into a situation that would normally make me anxious At this point you re probably thinking that I posted this in the wrong section and that it sounds like things are looking up Well they are and they aren t Getting over an anxiety disorder will cause relapses so I could have my anxiety under control for a few days and then a few days after feel like a wreck I m supposed to be looking at relapses as a positive thing because you can t have a relapse if you haven t made progress And I admit I have Here s the issue Although I have this whole whack of knowledge now and have seen in work first hand this requires a lot of work mentally See before I knew any of this I d just let the negative thinking flow freely but now anytime that occurs there are steps and things I need to do to escape for the vicious circle of anxiety On top of that there are things I m having trouble with now Getting out of the house can be a nightmare at times driving is nerve wracking at times Anytime I m stopped next to someone at a red light I tense up and freeze because I feel they are looking at me Even though I know that feelings can be false because they are created by thoughts and my thoughts are irrational Getting a job is another obstacle I ve yet to overcome I graduated from college months ago and have been unemployed since and to be honest as of late I ve been pretty much cooped up in my house with the occasional outing on weekends to a bar or lounge Every day when I wake up I know I have to prepare myself for another mental struggle with myself and it s tiring My friends don t usually contact me unless I initiate first And recently a friend who I ve known since I was has been really distant for some reason Bottom line is is it worth it I m no job can t even go to the store without having a battle with my own mind I just don t know what to do My family knows I have Anxiety but not specially Social Anxiety They don t understand that these simple things like going to the store or applying for a job are very challenging for me They chalk it up to me being lazy and unmotivated when in actuality if I had rid myself of this I would have be the polar opposite I want a future I don t want to be a deadbeat But at the same time there s only so long I can continue to get rid of my SA before I become tired I m starting to learn toward the it s not worth it side Can anyone give me some advice any advice If you read my entire post I really appreciate it TLDR Had a rough time in highschool no friends eventually diagnosed with social anxiety many years later tried medication that worked but eventually stopped Been doing cognitive therapy for the past months seems to be working but recently

Therapist told me not to call anymoreSo it s been years and counting of continually worsening depression I finally started seeing a therapist I really like and feel like I work well with about months ago I d say it took about two before I really felt like things clicked in and I wasn t so intimidated by the professional environment I am not at all the type who easily shares with others out of a combo of crippling shyness realizing others don t really know what to do say care etc so I basically have always been alone in my struggles I have an emotionally abusive mother and while my dad and I are on fine terms we re not super close I don t really have any friends to vent to as not many really know I have issues and regardless as mentioned previously they never know what to do or say and can t babysit me a year old Anyways after a few months my therapist said I could start calling her I felt so guilty every time I did because I hated the idea of being a burden and forcing her to take work home with her as who likes that I knew I was possibly overdoing it admittedly I was only doing it maybe a third of the times I ve felt super suicidal over the last few months but unfortunately I feel quite suicidal very often with this event surely worsening that Anyways today at our session she gave me her business card and said this is the best number to reach me on Like First of all I really hated how passive aggressive that was I would have MUCH preferred her telling me that I was calling too much and us discussing that Secondly there is no way anyone could ever believe that her office number is her best number as she s only in her office days so there would be no way to get in touch past pm when she leaves or on a weekend or the one day a week she starts in the afternoon Anyways now I feel super awkward and uncomfortable I knew this had to be coming but at the same time prayed it wouldn t and also really hated the way this happened as I would have preferred a confrontation This really made me panic because I honest to god have no one to talk to EVER in dire moments and honestly just worsened suicidal thoughts And now I feel like a huge step back has been taken in my comfort level as previously mentioned I do not open up well at all and I feel like this has just set me back on that exponentially harder as now I feel more like I am sitting in a job interview meeting with a teacher or employer etc than a therapy session In fact this really has made me never ever want to call her again on any phone number or use email to do anything but discuss scheduling matters I have a session tomorrow and honestly just want to cancel the one I have on Monday which is the first time I ve ever not wanted to go to therapy I just feel like I got punched in the stomach or something Anyways anyone have any input thoughts advice Thanks,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update, Seeking Help",high

depressed anxious and overwhelmedHi so this is going to be extremely rambly because I m so anxious depressed I can barely string thoughts together Right now I am in an outpatient program I was inpatient before that and I m terrified I have horrible suicidal thoughts every time I go home but when I m at the program I m fine My new medication is upsetting my stomach even more than how my stomach usually is and I was told to tolerate it for a couple more weeks and see if it will stop They want me to go home for good in a couple weeks and that s even after I bargained for more time My mom is spending tons of money for me to stay in a motel and drive a couple hours back and forth on the off days from home to the program I m beyond anxious and I feel like there s no solution to my problems and I feel like such a burden to my mom and it s driving me crazy I feel like I have no future I m and I don t have a job I m not in school I don t know what I want to go to school for maybe I want to be a therapist maybe that s what I think I SHOULD do because I think my life has no worth if I don t help people I dunno I don t know if I could even handle school I suffer from severe undiagnosed fatigue issues and also some GI issues from taking antibiotics for a year and I could only manage to take one class a semester when I was going I think I should probably go to school away from my family to get out of my shitty area and house and to become more independent and reduce distraction but I have this fear that by leaving my parents I m going to regret leaving and losing that time with them when they die which is very overwhelming aaaaaand lastly I have only one friend who I met through the program but they live hours and hours away from me so I m struggling to accept that too because I already feel attached and I m trying to find reasons to stay in the area afterwards like going to school in the area just so I can be close friends with them and hang out all the time I m really trying not to kill myself right now but I m just drowning in pain and anxiety and fatigue and I can barely get out of bed No one can seem to help me and I just want to die to make it all stop,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update",high

Thoughts of suicideI F don t know really I ve been touched by the darkness from a very young age maybe or and I ve been fighting the urge to end it all for just as long I think I m finally at the end of my rope so to speak my world has completely crumbled in more ways than one and I don t think there s much reason left for me to continue to pretend I want to be alive I wish I could say that things get better but they ve only gotten progressively worse,Critical Risk,high
I thought I had got past these thoughts This might sound weird but my Dad passed away quite suddenly two months ago I did get to talk to him before he died but it still hurts I had been quite suicidal prior to my dad s passing but for a month after those thoughts hardly entered my mind But now they seem to be the only thing that occupies my mind I been trying to deal with my depression with therapy and meds but I don t think they are really working This all came to the forefront since I quit my job to start a business with two friends but everyday I feel like we made a huge mistake and we are going to lose everything The business is puttering along but it has not taken off enough to pay us a wage Every month I juggle figures and hope we have enough money and credit to pay our bills I hate being the boss I wish I had never quit my job Sure you deal with the crap managers give you but at the end of the day you can go home and switch off unlike now where all I do day after day is worry about losing our home I really wish I could go back in time and undo this decision If some one presented my with a button that said it would kill me in my sleep in hrs I would push it and be thankful,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk",high

Physician heal thyself First off I work in healthcare and it s reached the peak for me at the start of the new year All the naive has been beat from me Nothing is going to get better about this system I came in with ideals and self preservation in mind I can help people and save lives maybe even spark change and I will have a solid skill set so that I am able to leverage my job as needed I m the squeaky wheel The squeaky wheel gets beaten into shape or drowned in oil until it stays quiet for ages knowing the price of making noise It got to me little by little And my counselor reminds me that this job doesn t define me and I need to be more than just my career when I think of my whole identity That s the absurd thing our careers have bred us to be the job to give our all to the job because not everyone can do the job just we few And fewer hold on long term And that s partially why We keep reverting back to our weak human forms despite the bumps injections and reindoctrinations of our God like ability and ego and hubris I am a failure I can only fight against this by truly letting go and it hurts so bad And the cure is not living day after day denying and downplaying I just want to end things because I can t take another psychological war fare because I stand up to the powers that be and cry foul I do it to protect my life and patients alike And my coworkers would rather sell me as sacrifice than pitch in and help I cant fix myself I can t fight the dark in me any longer I just want to be at peace,"Cause of Distress, Mental Distress, Positive Coping",medium

Im transHonestly I ve had mental health issues since I was very young it s not something I ve had diagnosed but the anxiety I feel when doing menial things like going outisde or being unable to talk on the phone is something I ve been feeling for longer than I can remember Now that I m older I ve also learned that my family has a history of mental health issues my brother has a personality disorder and struggled with self harm my dad has an anxiety disorder and has substance abuse problems and my auntie had serious substance abuse issues throughout her early adult life because she was trying to kill herself so really it feels like I ve been setup to feel like this In high school when I was I started self harming and at I tried to kill myself No one knew about the suicide except for a then close friend However the school had noticed my behaviour and my mum was called and I was assigned a councillor I went twice and quit and no one ever followed up on it Even my mum just told me I was being stupid This was also a time where both my best friends ghosted me and I never spoke to them again specifically because of the self harming Fast forward to and I m having identity problems and sexuality issues which puts a strain on my relationship with my ex We break up and years later I come out to my family and friends as transgender and my mum is just fine with it But no matter how many times I beg her to help me she refuses and won t take me to the doctor s I m and I essentially run away I ve lost all my friends where I live my dad is a waster and my mother refuses to help me So I move to England where some of my internet work friends live and life is good for a while It starts again I have arguments or just mood swings and I start cutting again It s pretty obvious because my wrists are covered and my flat mates do nothing no conversations or anything They just don t care I ve begged my close friend here to take me to the doctor s I ve even offered him money but he also refuses despite the fact I am literally mutilating myself in our flat Ive even asked what GP doctor s to go to because I don t know how it works but they don t even reply to me Tldr My old friends all left me the school didn t care my dad wasn t even in my life my mum doesn t want to help and my new friends couldn t care less And it seems soo silly but I just can t do it myself and I need someone right now but no one cares It doesn t matter what I do no one fucking cares enough to help not even my mum I don t even know what to do now it s like maybe if I killed myself it would just be easier It fucking sucks being trans and it fucking sucks being anxious about everything in life,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update",high

Too sick and poor to liveSicknesses I am blind in one eye scarred retina from birth have hypothyroidism and an undiagnosed stomach condition that I was told was barrette s stomach gastro paresis or my kidneys aren t filtering my blood correctly some sort of porphyria I get nauseated after every other meal I puke dry heave for hours and sit in a hot shower until it turns cold and then sit in a cold shower for an hour until I am nearly hypothermic Sometimes when in the hot water I dump ice water over my head to body shock the sickness away for a few seconds This gives me terrible colds that just add to the misery I ended up in the hospital for four days when I became so dehydrated that my kidneys were shutting down and my muscles were cramping up from lack of sodium I was given scopolamine Zofran and morphine When I was stable enough to hold down a bite of pancake they sent me home with a forty thousand dollar hospital bill and the recommendation that I see a specialist I applied for charity assistance from the hospital and have not seen a hospital bill since so I hope that money is not owed anymore A few months later I was lucky enough to get decent affordable health insurance which I used to get every test conceivable These tests went on for years and I was never given a definitive diagnosis My mother had end stage COPD and congestive heart failure She was on oxygen and could not leave the house She couldn t even make herself a meal without nearly suffocating to death My step father had throat cancer and liver cancer My step father had radiation treatment for the throat and liver but the throat cancer came back He then had a full laryngectomy When he came home from the hospital he was on a feeding tube and I had to crush his pills and feed him a liquid diet through his feeding tube He also needed his stoma cleaned and suctioned and a surgical wound that opened up packed and treated I did all this while also making meals for my mother doing the store runs laundry cleaning house and dealing with my own sickness The day after my th birthday in July my mother died from heart failure My Step father had been home from the hospital for one week when she passed and could not even speak They were married for years My step father s liver cancer has now come back and I fear he doesn t have long My finances I have been out of work for the past years I moved in with my mother and step father when I got too sick to work It worked out well for the three of us for the past years because despite my illness I was still able to take care of my terminally ill parents We were able to survive financially because of my parents disability checks and long term settlement check of per month and two rentals properties that were owned with no mortgage as long as there were renters anyway My uncles and my grandfather s ex wife which he was married to for years after the passing of his first wife of years now have complete control and ownership of the two rental units This past year the sickness has subsided somewhat and I want to get back to work but am afraid Afraid that the sickness will hit at work and get me fired again afraid to get back into to job market after being out for so long I inherited and now own my home with no mortgage but cannot pay the property taxes and insurance I am told I cannot take a mortgage out on my house because I don t have a job I also inherited a per month settlement check that will run out in two years It is not enough to live off and pay the taxes and insurance I also had to hire a lawyer in order to get the house and checks because my mother s will was not valid due to having been notarized with only one witness not two as per my state s law I still owe that lawyer dollars I am racking up penalties for the taxes I have yet to pay I will also be losing my health insurance at the end of this month because the premiums are going up by for the lowest tier plan It will be extremely difficult to try and find a roommate to move into the house because the house is in a state of disrepair and my terminally ill step father is in the master bedroom Who would want to move in with one sick dude and one terminally ill dude Plus the bedrooms are tiny I have two uncles One is in credit card debt and will offer no help the other has gifted me dollars since my mother s death but I cannot ask for more I have no idea how I am going to pay the bills next month I owe to a lawyer in medical bills that I know of in student loan debt in property taxes that are accruing penalties and about dollars a month in expenses insurance electric water etc I have A home valued by the city at but would sell for maybe due to that state of disrepair and per month for the next two years My plan I will leave a hand written will valid in this state leaving the house to my step father I will then acquire a small boat or kayak I will load a back pack with weights and travel as far east into the Atlantic Ocean as I can in one night Enjoy the stars and one last sunrise I will them get into the water wearing the backpack while hanging off the edge of the boat Then I will shoot myself through the brain This way if the bullet does not kill me the water will My body will sink into the depths below and that will be the end of me There will be no clean up no coroner no funeral just gone disappeared from the world

weeks ago on my th birthday i went to sleep with a plastic bag over my head after eating half a bottle of xanax because nothing makes any sense to me i am still unclear as to how i ended up in hospital and what went wrong all i know is my dad saved me When i was i use to have a reoccurring dream that went over my head at the time I would watch myself from a third person perspective sit in front of one of those old box TVs watching the tv static not being aware of anything else as i watched myself from an out of body perspective i would sometimes freak out and try to scream at myself and try to understand why i was unaware of anything outside of the TV static My last time having this dream i remember something stopping me from trying to snap myself out of this zombie state This was a calm feeling telling me that it is impossible for me to stop watching the static on the tv because i am apart of the tv i then got realizations that this whole life thing is just apart of some sort of box and there are things happening outside this box that our brains cannot come close to processing i remember waking up completely mind fucked and still to this day believe there is so much more going on in this thing than our brains can comprehend For years now it completely boggles me how people can live like sheep i really feel that people dont think for themselves how can people wake up every day knowing they are apart of some pointless scandle Humans turned this mysterious wonder into some sort of game to benefit people with money power Rich people get richer by paying poor people crumbs so they can work till they re just so they can put food on the table The poor person is told they should be grateful for there job even though they can and will be replaced with ease there are homeless kids halfway across the planet who are scratching their eyes out because they haven t ate in weeks people who run our world are born into money and as long as everyone is going with the flow things will be fine The worst part is it doesn t even matter we were given Goldilocks condition to paint our own picture so this corrupt world simply is what it is all i have known my whole life is that i would rather die than be alive in this shit,"Cause of Distress, Maladaptive Coping",medium

"I just find myself so useless. I have been dealing with social anxiety, others may find it easy to go out to work, but not for me. it is really stressful whenever I think about going out to work. Even if I have a job, I find it meaningless too, to wake up at 7am for a 9am job, reaches home at 7pm, only a few hours left to do my stuff and then sleeping early cos you got to get up early next day again, that goes on for the rest of my life which I do not like it at all. I tried to sell some stuff online to support myself financially, but that is not working out. Now that our breadwinner has passed on, we are left with a huge debt for housing loan, and also suffering from monthly utilities bills. Family and relatives only tell me to go out to work so that I can have an income to support the family. Others look down on me. Since I am so useless, I am slowly losing my will to live.

"a sick relative is causing me severe stress iâ€™m hoping i can post this anonymously so no one close to me can find it but i really donâ€™t know what else to do as everyone i talk to seems to tell me the same old crap that doesnâ€™t comfort me at all for context i am autistic and i donâ€™t like change in routine or bad things happening i also suffered a major trauma from a surgery i had 15 years ago and have gotten ptsd from it this also seems to happen whenever someone close to me is sick varying from mild to severe like this 
 
 so my mom has an infection she got it checked out and has been in the hospital ever since kept getting told it was nothing then got a text thursday night 8pm saying she was scheduled for surgery on it of course this sent me into overdrive and i was screaming down the phone to her saying to come home she had the doctor on the phone to me who said it was gonna be sepsis and there may be a need for amputation well of course this has led to me having panic attacks and everything i got sent home from work 
 i went to drop a few things off friday thinking that i was able to pick her up at dinner time just like i was told on the phone that was the next lie i was also refused entry to the room and had my things snatched from me and taken due to a panic attack i was told sheâ€™d come home at 8pm i was not corrected when i asked if amputation was needed or even necessary so this led to more worry on the way home 
 8pm arrives and i text momma to see if she wanted collecting and i get told no freaking no after i was told to my face to return at 8pm this was friday night and iâ€™m sure they knew exactly what they was doing because it escalates they say she can go home saturday 
 saturday i ask once again what time will momma be coming home and i get told once again midday i was at pride and thought cool theyâ€™ll be home when iâ€™m home oh no i get yet another text saying theyâ€™re not allowed to do any releases until monday despite saying that the infection had gone and stuff so i waited until monday monday rolls around and i ask once again what time i go into work trying to be normal i get a text at work telling me that the infection had never gone and wasnâ€™t allowed back for the 5th time itâ€™s now tuesday and i have been given the same crap i get every day a constant cycle of yes in the morning no in the evening i feel like iâ€™m not being told everything 
 
 this has caused me so much stress itâ€™s unreal first the nurses told my mom i was making things up and denied they said anything about sepsis or whatever they also havenâ€™t made me feel at ease at all lying to momma about going home then an hour later saying no for 5 days me and mom have gotten into arguments and then hours later iâ€™ll be on the phone sobbing and apologising like crazy only to be lied to again or the doctor not doing a release which starts the cycle again 
 
 i havenâ€™t eaten since saturday iâ€™ve not left the house in 2 days iâ€™m signed off sick from work for a week i canâ€™t stop crying my chest is so tight it hurts i have heart palpitations iâ€™m vomiting every time i try and put food in my mouth i have daily nosebleeds i have a constant sense of doom and if i donâ€™t get a text atleast once a day i automatically assume that something bad has happened 
 
 i just want to know is this panic all from past trauma i seem to freak out if anyone close to me has to be in the hospital for a period and itâ€™s to the point where iâ€™m getting sick over it constantly begging the person to come back home where it is â€œsafe from things like surgery and icuâ€ itâ€™s always the worst case that i fear and i even fear death everyone says itâ€™s too much tv but i canâ€™t even watch anything about medical stuff as it induces the same stress i googled about it being a severe fear or a trauma response but honestly i donâ€™t know i just want to know why i was lied to but no one will tell me","Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Seeking Help",low

What the hell do I do Hello This has taken me time I gather that this is not a very well read subreddit but I don t where else to post I am on the brink I do not want to be here any more however I do not deserve to be depressed I should be happy with my life but I want to die This makes me feel worse Here comes by story All my life I have been one of those mildly popular guys Never have I belonged to the elite of those popular but neither have I ever had to feel a lack of friends and neither have I have had to search for friend In short having friends have always been a given for me and I have even had friends who expressed jealousy because I had it all I had smarts I always had top grades in school yet I had friends among the cool kids and I always had girls However about half a year ago I started feel like shit I went on a trip with my then girlfriend We went to Cuba for vacation which we could afford because she worked in the travel industry and we could get very cheep tickets On the way there on then very flight I started to feel extremely nauseous bordering on unbearable nausea but we were only some minutes from landing so I pulled through When we arrived I didn t feel better and my nausea kept on albeit at a diminishing rate After a few days I felt fine Back home Sweden I felt almost fine but I would start having these bouts of nausea while at work These would sometimes result in me having to go home from work After a while with this I saw no other option than to go to a doctor This doctor told me that what I expressed seemed like nothing but stress I accepted this diagnosis as I at the time was very stressed out as I had my master s thesis and my work at the same time so I decided to wait things out Eventually my master thesis was finished and I passed and I had only my work to deal with But my nausea never ended At one time me and my then girlfriend went to the south of Sweden to go to a party This would normally entail two hours of train but because of whatever fuckup the train was cancelled and we had to go by bus I took extremely ill during the busride At the time I thought it was common motion sickness but I have never in my life previously been motion sick and I grew up on boats and on cars I shouldn t suffer from motion sickness Nevertheless I ascribed my sickness to motion sickness but I fell ill for more than two weeks Luckily we caught a ride with a car back to our home town which was horrible but better than a bus ride but back home I didn t get better so I finally started to think my ailment was psychosomatic After this I would frequently have bouts of what I can only describe as anxiety My doctor prescribed hydroxine to me which helped momentarily and I am on it now as I write and I feel fine My relationship with my girlfriend finally ended as she went on a semester abroad I felt nothing but relief as I could finally focus on my self I no longer had her to think of I contend that the failure of our relationship was due to my constant depression and not to her leaving I was supposed to go with her but just couldn t Here s the bad part As single I ve been extremely successful I ve constantly have had girls I ve slept around and I have even had offers for long term relationships Yet I have never been happy I have been extremely unhappy I am extremely unhappy I write this from a throwaway but any one of my friends who happen upon this post can easily identify from my circumstances My point is I am extremely unhappy I return home from having been offered to sleep with a girl yet still I did not want to i seriously do not believe it to be related to my former relationship I simply do not want to live any more I am severely depressed I suffer from random bouts of nausea and anxiety which I personally subscribe wholly to something psychosomatic Still I am very much aware of the fact that I do not deserve to be unhappy I have everything going for me I have a great education and girls throw themselves at my feet yet whatever happens I want to die I return tonight from a night on the town that resulted in at least two offers of coitus but I want to die I always want to die I usually am not suicidal I have no wish to end my own life I just wish to die But tonight something was different I think it was because I met an old crush of mine and my failure to ever get with her got to me but never the less tonight was the first time I ever wanted to end my life I am fully aware that the above text does nothing but convince people that I should not even be depressed But that is my problem I am so fucking depressed and the fact that I know I shouldn t be just makes things worse I hate myself for being depressed and I think I should just man up and so thinks everyone I ve told

"Throwaway for privacy reasons. I will try keep this short and to the point.
 
 I am part of a friendship group. We've been close friends since middle school and are now in our late 20s.
 
 Amongst this group is L. I have known L since I was about 6. I used to love going to his house on play dates because there were no sense of rules. He's from an incredibly wealthy family who never spent much time supervising him. Play dates at L meant no bedtime, do whatever you want, buy whatever you want, reality did not exist there.
 
 L grew up without ever needing a cent - he was and has always been very generous about spending on his friends, sharing the hedonism, etc. He spent most of his 20s bouncing between various colleges but not completing any courses. He managed to receive a diploma in video game development.
 
 In his early 20s he began to develop this misogyny that has just gotten worse. He is an overt (who thinks he's subtle) pickup artist. He will bounce between his ""tinder boos"", hanging onto them until he's fucked them and then dump them and move on. His father was the same and it's surprising that he does not realize the implications of that kind of behavior.
 
 To get a girl in bed he will use every trick outlined in The Game as well as more insidious techniques. He will tell them they're the one and he loves them. He'll be fucking other girls on the side until he beds his latest conquest, then she gets thrown into the gutter.
 
 This bothers all of us in the group, we don't agree with that kind of misogyny. We give him shit for it, we know it's not right, but he's always been good to us. He's funny to be around. His warped sense of reality can be hilarious.
 
 But now here's the kicker.
 
 L has started working at my company. He's been there for less than a month while I've been there for two years.
 
 These traits of his are coming out very negatively now. He is trying to seduce every girl in the office. He is subtly undermining my authority in the office in front of woman.
 
 At a staff function on Friday (which I left early) he got incredibly wasted, hooked up with a girl from the office (at the same time, cheating on his girlfriend who he was taking out for a Valentine's day lunch the next day), lied to my boss about taking the taxi she ordered for him home and drove himself without bothering to inform any of his friends.
 
 We spent all night stressing and panicking because he was supposed to meet up with us an hour earlier and was unreachable. We drove around the city trying to retrace his steps before finding out he just went home.
 
 I've been paying more attention to his behaviour in the office. He is telling outright lies to people, his intonation changes when he speaks to females - he is simply a different person than the one that we chill with out of work and it's actually become very worrying. When I try call out his bullshit in front of other people, he will either totally ignore it or he reverts to some PUA technique he's memorized about handling conflict.
 
 Last night, another friend of mine asked me some yes or no questions related to L's attitude towards woman, and his attitude in general. I answered yes to every question. Turns out it was an ASPD checklist.
 
 I'm incredibly concerned now. I've never really known what a sociopath was but I think I'm dealing with one now.

 Why doing so and not being at all happy about it, even angry at yourself?
 Why those people disappear once you stuck on their side when they were in distress? Or was it you pushing them away, because you feel that now that you aren't needed you will be discarded? Or them changing their attitude? Are you the jerk at the end ? Or is it them ?

week because I was seriously ready to kill myself My doctors are pretty cool I have a good rapport with my shrink But since I couldn t be fixed to an acceptable level within the time allotted I am being medically discharged Short of serving and getting retired it s the best way to leave I ll get something like of my base pay for as long as I m fucked in the head Still want to kill myself I picture myself living in a shitty apartment no job bored miserable drunk etc I was also diagnosed with alcohol abuse disorder I was told not to drink for months at which point I could return to responsible alcohol use afterwards I complied mostly to prove them wrong but also to see how I would feel sober As you can imagine it was terrible not being able to drink especially when everybody else is The cocksuckers lied to me though told me that I was still too much at risk after the and that mixing antidepressants and alchol is a no no Like I give a shit I tried their ways I stayed sober did the CBT kept a fucking diary and so on The best advice they offer is find a purpose and distract yourself Still fucked up Still want to die Oh and because I VOLUNTARILY seeked treatment I was referd read forced for alcohol abuse treatment Because I was was in that I am automatically getting marked down on my annual performance report In the grand scope of things it doesn t mean shit but GOD DAMN what a fucking kick int he balls I save the fucking day countless times setting up that fucking eqiuptment but nobody gives a shit I m mintues late to work and all hell breaks loose I get

stupid afterwards ya know Like embarressed with myself for even entertaining the thougth that this time will be different Then tonight I find out that my friend who barely tries and doesn t even give a shit either way got fucked some girl last night I know I can t compare myself to him apples and organges But holy fuck did that shit sting A kind of envy that pierces my fucking soul like a red hot fireplace poker And ya know it s not so much that I m alone It s that I can t overcome the human nature of needing someone It isn t even about sex it s about that Caritas the non judemental love the feeling of mattering to someone Shit maybe I wasn t held enough as a baby or something I just think to myself okay fine I don t get to have anyone That s shitty but fine I ll accept that Can I at least be content alone No I need to feel lonely and miserable huh No matter what I read and where I search I won t find any answers and I can t make the pain any less huh That s fucked up When I do kill myself I ll do my best to explain it wasn t being an unwanted social retard that killed me it was not being able to just fucking let it go I m unwanted Fine Life goes on right No I feel this pain until the very end I killed myself because I couldn t fucking get over it So fucking weak And now it s time for me to freshen my drink Thank you for taking the time to read my bullshit,"Cause of

Long Story Need supportI ve been depressed suicidal for a long time but it s gotten worse over the past year It started last year I chose my best friend to be the one to take my virginity because I trusted him He felt honored that I had chosen him and it was a big deal Unfortunately I got a really bad ovarian cyst so we couldn t do it right away We promised to wait until I was completely better He broke that promise when he started dating his cheating girlfriend a few months after She has another boyfriend and she s cheating on him with my best friend and she has made excuses for not wanting to break up with her original boyfriend for my best friend The fact that he broke our promise really hurt me A few months after he started dating her I was sexually harassed on my way home from school I was on a public train during the winter and this guy started harassing me Another man defended me However the offender proceeded to threaten the guy by saying he was going to shoot him He didn t pull out a gun but the threat was there I got out of the train as soon as the doors opened After that I wanted to see my best friend for support I told him what happened and had asked him if we could meet up over the weekend the incident took place on a Monday But he decided that spending the weekend at his cheating girlfriend s place was more important than helping me I couldn t keep my feelings about everything anymore and I decided to talk to my best friend about it We got into a fight over it It turns out that he had forgotten about the promise we had made and that has permanently changed the way I saw the world People always say to think about your loved ones and how they would feel if you committed suicide but after what he did I couldn t help but think that if it was so easy to forget a promise that big how easy is it to forget someone s existence If I committed suicide no one would miss me They d simply forget about me my abusive family my friends everyone so it wouldn t matter He also tried justifying him choosing to stay at his cheating girlfriend s place over supporting me but the thing is it s not like she was in trouble or in need of support or anything He also didn t have work I needed him and in a moment of need he picked his girlfriend over me which is something he promised to never do but I guess he broke that promise out of desperation considering how many failed relationships he s had He said if I had considered if the guy who harassed me was bluffing about the gun Of course I had considered it and so did the police however threats of using a weapon are taken extremely seriously Plus I didn t know if he was bluffing or not He could have been but he could also have been serious I told him that work is understandable for not being able to see me during that time but going to his girlfriend s house instead of helping me during an important time is not and that he can go to her house at any time He said Still it s what I chose to do cause I wanted to We fought some more I did hurl a few insults here and there and he said he s not going to talk to me for insulting him for spending time with his girlfriend We eventually apologized and made up The thing is the damage has been done and I m still hurt by everything I haven t completely forgiven him either I can t look at the world the same This combined with living in an abusive household and being made of my family and family friends about me eating I m skinny has taken a toll I think about suicide almost all the time and I have no one to talk to I ve tried antidepressants but the ones I ve tried so far haven t worked for me so I m still looking for the right one I see a psychiatrist and a counselor at school but it s summer break and I can t see anyone now especially because I live with a narcissistic mom I ve attempted suicide a few times during the summer including on my birthday I can t stop thinking about suicide I don t know what to do I ve contacted hotlines a few times but I don t want to be a nuisance and they re not always helpful Nothing seems to be working anymore I want to die I wish I was never born I hate the world I don t want to be here anymore,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update, Seeking Help",high

At war with my self sabotageHi I was diagnosed with depression years ago My abusive family didn t care about my meds so I had to be reanimated after suicide attempt as a teenager As an adult I endured being homeless twice years then a few months progressing disability sight loss suspicion of MS chronic pain and other constant lack of money selling myself for a place to live a year when I stayed in bed for days skipping showers and food I managed to finish school after years of dropping out I became homeless while still attending high school and even got accepted at uni our schools are free I did my best to follow meds and therapy plans worked on myself and my reactions tried to be more open to people After ten years of hard mental work I finally can notice and name my emotions see that not choosing is still a choice and understand how my head works All my friends say I ve changed a lot and for better Yet I have a new crisis For last year I ve been slowly ruining my education by skipping classes and not using opportunities created by pretty decent uni authorities I m stuck in therapy because I can t make any further progress until I force myself to do something change something It feels almost physical when I try to shove myself into sticking with my own plans even though they re not big ones I tried to get a part time job to get back on job hunting market but I had to quit it after damaging my sight even more Right now I m at the verge of becoming homeless again got kicked out of the uni and with no money for most meds I already asked my friends to pay some bills and meds for me and I don t want to ask too often I see how my self destructive part gains more and more power over the reasonable one however I still can see how ridiculous it is I m really afraid that after two years with no serious suicide thoughts I ll do something irreversible I also get urges to cut my arms which I hadn t done for almost years I feel safer when doing nothing even though I know it s way more dangerous Today I cried in the middle of street because I can t take this amount of stress anymore How does one force themselves to act How to motivate yourself to fight I m sure I want to live but I m also sure I m not able to live this way anymore Suicide seems like bad decision but the only one which can give me some peace I see it like a tooth removal you don t want to get rid of your teeth but it s so damaged it s the only way to get rid of pain,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update",high

A Meaningless RantHonestly I don t know how to properly put this into words but I feel the need to so I can get some proper sleep rn I have no goals I m a Christian without faith and can t find the point to living anymore I m years old and have never felt more tired in my life in Uni as my daily life drains me more and more And I ask myself every bloody day what s the point of being here I want to die to begin with but I had to have the typical fear of maiming and surviving This isn t a new question it s been haunting me for about years and I don t know how to get any drive back nor has my life improved The coffee doesn t help nor does the medicine I get that people say uni and studying are for the future and they re necessary skills trades But why bother with it when your suicidal the amount of time I envision myself dying is probably more than I study daily I m just taking a random course to begin with so I don t even know why I m even going to uni probably to just meet expectations It s not that I have no one I have friends and family that I can rely on and I know it s a privilege But I just can t seem to find the drive to keep on going as the older I get the worse it becomes In conclusion I guess I wanted to come out and rant to a bunch a strangers about it since I don t know how my friends or non family would take it I ve told my parents that I am in fact suicidal weeks ago they took it well a bit too calmly idk nothing has changed in our relationship for better or worse Ps sorry for the poorly flowing sentences I haven t seen my class on how to write a proper suicidal rant,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk",high
Suicide is not an option for me That s not just a tired saying it s my reality But if it s the only thing I can think about where do I go from here I cross posted from r depression I m sorry if you see this twice I ve been lurking here on my main for a long time and I don t know that I fit in I m sorry if my situation isn t relatable It sounds really stupid I have a great life I know many people are alone but I m not no matter how much I keep trying to be I try to push my friends and family away but I can t I had a pretty traumatic childhood but all those people have been out of my life for a decade and my remaining family are amazing Suicide is absolutely not an option for me I have too many people who care about me I know I know how this sounds Once my dad and grandma pass away then it s very much on the table friends and other relatives may be sad but they will get over it However my dad was a young parent and therefore is very young and healthy I ve got a couple decades before that becomes a reality Sometimes I resent that and that s the darkest thought I ve ever had I ve never told anyone this before but in my worst moments I am upset that my dad my favorite person in the world is still alive and healthy and going to stay that way because that means I have to stay alive for a few more decades too and I really don t want to I m also gainfully employed in a job I used to love and really should still love I m not wealthy but I can support myself My job is incredibly stressful but my coworkers are good people my boss is a good person I believe in the work and it pays the bills even in my very expensive city I have friends and the ability to have more friends but instead of going out and socializing I just keep pushing more and more people away I just don t know where to go from here I feel like I have to keep it all up working being a normal person or faking it as best as possible I isolate myself a lot I never go out but still my friends are there It s very weird and confusing I don t know how I got so lucky Not only are my friends still around no matter how much I avoid them but they re all very cool people they re intelligent and successful and have so much going for them in their lives I don t know how I ve tricked all these people into being my friends or how I ve tricked my job into keeping me employed or how I ve tricked my family into being so supportive But I have and I need to undo all of this without hurting anyone I don t want to be alive anymore Every time a minor thing goes wrong that thought hits me like a ton of bricks Every time I m alone and I m alone a lot all the same But I don t know what to do I feel so fucking trapped But my amazing supportive friends and family would be absolutely crushed if I told them any of this and they d probably have me committed They d probably try to make me quit my stressful job as most of my complaints about life to them are framed around my job which is stressful yeah but a mentally healthy person could handle this hell even a slightly more healthy version of me from a few years ago could handle it Then I d have nowhere to go nothing to do My friends and family would get tired of me and I d be in the same situation as so many people who are alone It s like I ve got it backwards I have no reason to be depressed right now but I am cripplingly so But if I tell anyone my life will be turned upside down and I ll have a genuine reason to want to die for the first time since I was I just don t know where to go from here I m sorry if this was rambling and hard to follow And I m sorry if this sounds self involved or bragging I don t understand why I ve gotten so unfairly lucky in life either I wish someone more whole had all these good things going from them I would genuinely love it if nobody would miss me I know that sounds awful,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Seeking Help",high

The thought of the end is the only thing that makes me happy I m not entirely sure what to say I often find myself lost for words but now I need them more than ever I have been depressed for a while now and I have tried oh lord have I tried to get rid of it to make it disappear I no longer think I have the capability to be happy it seems almost impossible I m going to apologize in advance for the inevitable essay but this is my first post and I have a lot of things I need aired I need someone to hear me to listen to me before I explode First of all my mother died when I was she was and died suddenly Obviously there was a lot of heart ache sadness and so on the stuff you would normally expect from anyone who loved their mother My father worked away so my sister and I never had a stable home sometimes we lived with my Nan and Grandfather other times we would stay with my Auntie and then occasionally my other Nan would look after us My mother s mother was a wonderful person I finally allowed myself to open up to someone and she took me in with open arms She was the only person who would tell my father when he was wrong She died when I was To this day seeing my Grandfather cry was the most heart wrenching thing I have ever witnessed I then found a wonderful boyfriend he treated me like I was everything but of course my best friend didn t like sharing my time with someone else and then she left my life too I still miss her It was at this time that I had noticed that my eczema had started to get worse and nothing was curing it I took my skin problem to a doctor and was referred to a dermatologist He was baffled and had no idea what it was tried different tests and treatments but to no avail Since then I have been to various doctors around the UK travelling far and wide to seek treatment My condition got even worse my body was is covered Itchy and sore Later that year my uncle died and then so did my Grandfather I started to think it was all my fault and that maybe I was a curse to my family I tried to commit suicide three times and carved the shit out of my thighs I stopped eating properly because I thought I was enormous I weighed kg My boyfriend could no longer handle me I was erratic and self destructive He left after two years of suffering me It was at this point that I had really decided that life wasn t for me I was in pain all day every day because of my skin I had to leave school after my GCSE s because the pain was unbearable and I could hardly motivate myself to leave my bed I then got diagnosed with a new illness called Myasthenia Gravis for those who don t wish to Google the disease it is simply something which makes your muscles incredibly weak to the point where it is hard to walk eat and sometimes even talk I am now on steroids which is helping but the condition isn t curable I am just hoping that it will go into remission someday On top of all this I had to look after my year old sister since my grandparents were no longer around to do so Huff I am starting to feel like I am writing this for the wrong reasons I feel like I m writing a sob story and that wasn t what I wanted I ll quickly explain what happens after that I decided to get myself better mentally tried so unbelievably hard finally felt like I succeeded got my boyfriend back after a year of trying moved out of my house and into my boyfriend s parents house because my father was verbally abusive and kind of got my social life back on track But here I am now Back where I started Rejected all of my friends again Too afraid to leave the house My boyfriend is wonderful but I feel like he can t give me what I need I sit here every day feeling like there is a massive empty space inside of me I m desperately trying to find something to fill it but there is nothing I want nothing from this life anymore If I knew that I could die tomorrow without hurting my boyfriend or my sister I would do it I would end it I have no one to talk to because I am too afraid of losing my boyfriend again and I don t trust anyone else I am poor as shit because I had to leave school because of my illnesses and couldn t get a job for the same reason The government is also unwilling to help at all I am now kg heavier than I was before because of my medicines and I feel like an elephant I am terribly unsatisfied with the way that I look I have seen a glimpse of happiness and it is totally not worth the effort This sounds incredibly gay I have no idea who I am anymore and I am so scared for my future I just want to curl up into a ball and fade away I have tried to leave out my father in all of this because even thinking of him makes me angry however I will tell you this that man can go to hell for what he has put me through I am not living I m just wasting time TL DR Was depressed then happy ish and now I see no point in living,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update, Seeking Help",high

Dear my friends who read this and everyone else Hi I m James You have never met me or will likely never do so I am a depressed year old boy who is trapped in life and a viscous circle It started at the ripe old age of Entering Year th grade I always knew adjusting into a secondary school wouldn t be the easiest but hell I tried getting on with everyone It seem some people just don t get along I was average weight for a guy my size and was always healthy Now however is no longer the case You see bullying destroyed me Not in the sense of mentally where i just lost it one day and lashed out No it literally picked my life apart and my future bit by bit The person i was back in Year th grade no longer exists I was happy looking ahead to what could be an amazing life with a nice enough personality likeability and body to go with it But that changed I got along well with the group of friends I joined in the second year of my secondary school Though we were classified as I suppose the nerdy ones Up to this point everything was fine That is when I was destroyed forever past present and future I started to get bullied then again so do a lot of kids but it affected me more than others For months I would take the bullying and abuse shrugging it off but I was comfortable I started eating more and more to feel safe it was my little thing i always held close food It was like an anti bullying anti depressant for me it was weird but nevertheless what comes with eating more food is weight I started gaining weight out of control I went from this little lbs kid to over lbs in a matter of a couple months I could no longer run hell even jog By mid end of Year I was heavily obese with asthma problems But i wouldn t run or exercise in general because i was still made fun out of You know fat fuck running to loose some weight yeah I was but I said i was just going somewhere and would just stop running Moving on i was bullied through my schooling more and more Still gaining more and more weight by the start of Year it was Suddenly noticed by a relatively new teacher a teacher who came to be a saving grace Though too little to late a saving grace nevertheless This teacher we ll call him John saw me gaining weight eating way more than i should getting told off for eating in class or slagging off daydreaming probably about killing myself or how much better my life would be somewhere else Now in the UK year is the final year for schooling so it was highly important to revise for exams and get through the school day This I could not do hell I couldn t even get to school without being out of breath or faking an illness to get a day away John finally gave in and gave me the rest of the year off to revise for exams and get prepared for the end of the year I never did prepare i slept my days away glad that i would never have to go back apart from exams where i was separated from the people who destroyed my life I did my exams and failed most of them Completing my schooling This was the best thing that had ever happened to me leaving this place Though it still lived on in my head and heart killing me every time i thought about it Even to this day if i have to walk past or drive past the school i end up in tears over the time i spent there The only person i have to thank in my life the only person who cared Who gave a damn The only person who loved me like a brother Who saw the pain the suffering The times i said i wanted to kill myself Wo then went and told John the person who saved me more than anyone else could My friend Niall He is part of my little family My true saving grace Months of grief even after leaving the school i kept saying i was ok even though dying inside I luckily got accepted into a college that i did fine at I stopped eating as much though Still way more than i should I was left alone there i didn t know anyone made no friends and was alone THIS is where everything stopped being about the bullying and the shit i was given at my last school But inside i knew they caused me to be overweight and not great to look at So now i was lonely and sunk into deep depression a depression i never uttered a word about for years I dropped out of my college for personal issues and had months off Still obtaining a good grade from that college i moved into another one immediately as the next school year turned over Thinking i was over from all this shit thought everything was ok after my months off It was not i entered the new college where there were girls everywhere with boyfriends being happy my mind slipped back into a state of horrific depression worse than anything else I started eating more and more again on top of that i was still lonely with know one i know attending this college either After weeks at the college i cracked to my parents i cried for hours that day pouring years of abuse and depression all at once but never once uttering i was lonely because the way to deal with it is loose weight and become healthy young guy again become who i wanted to be since i was that little th grader But i knew that i was never going to be that person so i decided what i was going to do But that would have to wait First i went to my doctor who put me on the SSRI Citalopram i was taking mg for weeks to no effect I was then moved up to mg and i was sent to emergency youth counselling I was there for weeks once a week Telling this woman everything about me and what went on not once crying or hurting It was just nice to feel free telling someone that was going to tell know one else about the real side of my depression After the first week i told my closest friend Niall about the real side of me everything I continued on with counselling as did my depression The Citalopram didn t work After weeks i told my councillor that i was fine and that she helped a lot But she knew that i wasn t fine I started to self harm and drink making myself more depressed and wallowing in self pity I went out a lot of times one month with friend told not to drink But i still did I self harmed more and more Then the best thing that ever happened in my life came up It was a weekend in mid April A weekend i was looking forward to no special event i just was Niall invited me to an anime convention Now i wasn t even an anime fan I d only ever watched Gurren Lagann but i went along and for that one weekend i was free I was happy i had camera round my neck and by GOD did i abuse it I used it as an excuse to talk to people Girls mostly I got more love and affection in that one weekend than i did in my entire life I was truly not alone or unhappy I had people notice the cuts all down my arm being only a day or old they were raised and red Rather easy to see Though know one questioned them and for that i was happy That one weekend was the best days of my life Thank you for that Niall After that i was next sent to the doctor weeks after initial counselling ended The doctor saw my wounds and suggested i go to a psychiatrist So naturally i did still on the citalopram so at this point i was still depressed The psychiatrist put me on a new drug called Mirtazapine i was in mg of the stuff for weeks and it did a hell of a lot more than the citalopram ever did I was feeling better I wasn t depressed but i was still a bit lonely Now i not usually the one to beg people or bother them but the only other assistance i had stopping me killing myself was music this artist in particular being Veela one night i sent her this email http i imgur com PPbHq png I didn t expect a reply from her being as popular as she is I mean she made some pretty popular music http www youtube com watch v HzBL nK Zo among the gaming community To my surprise she did Not by a simple little email either she went

Will Pedophilia Happen To Be Normalized In the Future Pedophilia is not something new we all have been sickened or rather even angered by the very existence of it However in the recent past weeks a large number of social media accounts news articles and even memes have been discussing the very topic of the so called MAPS self identified maps aka pedophiles and how they are trying to normalize themselves by trying to get along with LGBtQ communities and even going as far as creating a flag to represent themselves Personally as a person who is extremely critical to topics of pedophilia and rape I was sickened and was worried In a recent talk with one of my friends about these topics we saw how people of LGBTQ communities were oppressed and were often hated and harassed by the general public and how it can still be seen in our older generation such as our grandparents and even our peers often labeling them as unnatural I was told about how just like in the past the people who hated LGBTQ communities are now considered conservative and parochial one day we might be too be seen like this but in this case it would be due to our disagreement with the very presence of pedophiles Countless underaged children are being abused and over sexualize for the sake of entertainment and fame by their parents and guardians and it has provided with a means of media for these pedophiles and you can virtually find child porn in literally any hentai Japanese pornographic art labeled as loli available at one click away Will in the future after common interaction of people about such sensitive topics make them numb and result in pedophilia to become destigmatized and be a thing of the future and we have to stay quiet about it I as a person is genuinely scared and angered with the very possibility and the helplessness I feel Please let me know what you think tl dr Will pedophilia become common and legalized and we will be known as the boomers of the future generations,"Cause of Distress, Mental Distress, Positive Coping",medium

Hey Are you up for the challenge of matching up to find a friend based on questions Covers age gender interests this be the real continent willingness to share pictures or voice calls studying working status and more Hello and behold prepare for a longish post xD was an intense and lonely year for many of us which is one of the main reasons my friend u finder of the humans spent months on a friend finding project that uses questions to find you compatible people to form friendships with It s the coolest project I ve come across in a while hence my posts Please note you need to be or older How it works Step Find compatible matches Basically it matches people up based on answers to simple questions You choose your answer and also answers from people you would want to talk to This is your compatible matches list Step Friend requests Once you have the list you can then send out friend requests to these users or receive requests from them and once either of you have accepted a request you get connected with that person you form a friendship You eventually meet up get married years later you get divorced and fight over the who gets the coffee table with lawyers involved Why this is awesome Reach Over people have joined which means most people get matches people active in the past two weeks If you re very picky or a general outliner you could expect a bit less Time It ll save you a bunch of time Imagine how long it d take you to message people individually What are the questions more about you age you have to be or older best part of your day gender sexuality interests we have a HUGE list to pick from all the way from lockpicking to biotechnology to minecraft geographical continent how often you d like to communicate with a friend type of friendship whether you d be willing to share pictures whether you d be willing to have voice calls religious working studying video games books drinking smoking drugs whether you want to hide not match with low effort profiles Sounds sketchy or you have concerns A few people have concerns about the above So I can highlight a few things You can be completely anonymous if you choose and probably should be anyway just use throwaway contact info There is a very simple and short privacy policy as well And lastly you can read through everyone s feedback in previous posts from a while back here https www reddit com user finder of the humans posts https www reddit com user finder of the humans posts as well as mine Okay woohoo lets do this The link is https findafriend club howitworks https findafriend club howitworks This is an example of the UI for a match https imgur com a Dfqp ES https imgur com a Dfqp ES If you have any questions I ll be happy to answer them I m based in Europe so might be sleeping in US time Final tips I d encourage you not be shy to send requests to people that is the point quite a few people sign up and don t send out any requests People do have the option to hide their profile if they get too many people talking to them so it s safe to assume that if you see their profile they re probably still looking for a friend Also there is sadly a bug with email notifications recently Extra info You can be completely anonymous if you prefer you would need a disposable throwaway method of contact Most people get around active matches If you get less make sure you have filled out the form correctly If you include people who haven t been active in weeks it s You can send outgoing requests per h period Email notifications about requests friends get sent out every minutes though not everyone added an email Matches are done instantly But you still have to wait for the user to accept your friend requests This project is completely non profit and there is no advertising We re looking for help if you want to help and also there is a patreon if you want to support it in that way u finder of the humans https www reddit com u finder of the humans runs this project I m helping out with getting more attention A big big thank you to them,"Cause of Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Mental Distress",medium
Hmm I can t think of a good title that isn t generic I ll say it s a normal suicidewatch wall of text I ll start off by saying that I am not going to kill myself If I know one thing about myself it is that I am terrified of dying and will do everything in my power to make sure that doesn t happen I ll try to be short and concise Walls of text are boring and honestly everyone has probably heard all of this before Currently age male live alone with dog no friends one psychologist therapist diagnosed with depression ADHD anxiety type diabetes Backstory years college dropped out many psychologists and therapists many different diagnoses choleric temperament hard to work with upper middle class white extreme guilt of not living to potential years ago I broke down in college and basically stopped everything I hated myself and everyone I was angry frustrated and sad As the years progressed I became more isolated As of now I have maybe one friend I talk to on facebook who moved away a year ago I have no job I dislike speaking to my parents and I really only go out at night when I take my dog out for a walk I guess I also talk to my psychologist he is the only one I have ever not hated It seems that the only way to change ones predicament is to want to change My parents have money I am not in jail and I am relevantly smart I know depression causes a lack of motivation and all that but it s not just that When I would get a job a shitty one I would become quickly bored I never last more than a month and usually I do something I m not supposed to do before I quit crash company s servers make people angry at me ect I am told I have the potential to be smart but then everything I do is wrong I basically have to have my hand held to do anything correctly and it takes me many tries to learn to do anything and I am completely bored I know people with depression and other mental illnesses have a hard time seeing their life in a clear light There is a fog that we supposedly cannot penetrate even though we believe we can I believe I can and the one thing I do with all my time is research and read textbooks articles and studies on illnesses and general philosophies Am I right I am sure I am not though I have a really hard time trusting other people when their view differs from mine Anyway I see my lack of motivation But it isn t because I feel like I can t do things I have done things but I forget them so quickly I have to relearn them over and over Usually I can do something once and then I lose the motivation to do it again A solution people come up with is not to get disillusioned by failure If you ask out one girl and get rejected then ask out until someone says yes but that isn t the problem The problem is I am so extremely lonely but the girls I see I hate I don t want a gf I don t want real friends and then I am stuck in this world I made of utter complete loneliness that I don t want either but it is a lot easier to handle My majors in college became boring as I was studying them I couldn t keep going on I always felt like I wasn t learning well enough I would forget what I learned the year before and feel lost even though I had ok grades I always felt like people were judging me so I never connected with students and eventually I would quit just like all of my jobs and the few girls who did go out with me a couple of times I always end everything and it seems my cutoff point is about a month I feel this insane guilt of doing nothing for society and taking so many of its resources to keep me alive My fear of death makes it so that I am constantly trying to find the best medical help I worry about every pain and problem with my body I don t want to die but I feel as if I am too broken to be fixed and that death is this only thing left for me There is this schism in me where I am cocky independent egotistical unique ect and then there is this other part of me that has no confidence needs babying scared and obviously unoriginal There is no bipartisanship between any of my feelings so I can get something done and leave this horrid place I don t trust anyone not even myself but then I judge myself by everyone s advice and what I believe When I am alone I wish I wasn t and when I am with company I wish I was alone I fear death and yet I wish for it constantly I wish people would do stuff for me and when they do I become incensed that they would do such a thing I get a gf a job a school and think immediately about leaving Anyone who used to care about me I think has long given up Everyone except myself and the psych who I pay loads of money to I think they gave up half because it was confusing and half because what I say made no sense and so I became untrustworthy I would have conversations where someone would suggest something and I would say I couldn t do it They would try to help and I would say no thanks I can do it myself I can see how it makes no sense and yet I still understand how both things I said were completely true Holy shit What a wall of text I can t even TL DR it because it still feels like I missed the point TL DR How do I stop being a white male privileged little bitch,"Cause of

Am I crazy or just sleep deprived So I ve been told that I have a very keen sense of smell as I can smell something cooking from across the house when no one else can smell it but sometimes I smell things that don t make a ton of sense like smelling root beer when I m alone in my room with no soda in the middle of the night and I just heard what sounded like faint whispering like the kind shows will play when they re trying to create a creepy ambiance but idk it could have been a combination of people moving around and a dripping faucet mixed with my paranoia I didn t get a lot of sleep last night and I don t tend to get a lot of sleep in general could it just be sleep deprivation I saw a therapist a while back and the whole out of body coping mechanism thing came up because I d been having a lot of that and he asked me if I d been smelling things that didn t make sense because that can mean olfactory hallucinations which can relate to psychiatric problems that tie into the out of body thing but I said no at the time because while I figured I probably had I couldn t think of any specific instances But that whole conversation kinda made me paranoid Am I fine I mean probably,"Cause of Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Mental Distress",medium
"Hello fellow friends 😄
 
 I'm on the BPD spectrum and have discouraged (silent) borderline characteristics.
 
 There are different levels to experiencing anger. I was wondering, what are yours? And how do you express it? What's a healthy way you found to cool it down?
 
 For me I will first become silent and blame myself, ""maybe if I"" or ""If I only"", ""maybe he's just not having it today"", ""maybe I simply don't get him due to my own shortcomings in understanding"". However, I find it interesting how, when someone hurts the ones I love, I tend not to demonize myself no more in the extend I would normally do, but rather the aggressor. In extreme cases this can lead to my maximum expression of anger. I don't know whether you guys get to experience this as well? 
 
 I have written this as a reaction to another post and it illustrates what this anger would look like:
 
 ""The maximum amount of rage. it's like I blackout. I call it cold rage. No sense of pain whatsoever, pure anger. It's the point people don't recognize me anymore, because I will dissociate in anger. My field of view will become a pinpoint, I will start breathing superficially, and even lash out to the ones I love trying to calm me. It's disgusting and the insanity itself. I must say this only happened once in my life, when the ex of my sister encouraged her to mix her psych meds with drugs and alcohol and so she went into deep psychotic state for the first time of her life. He didn't even let us know what had happened, my sister just came home in that state. Then he called her and told her she's completely bonkers, instead of alarming the rest of the family. I'm shaking as I'm writing this because I know it's still the rest of anger inside me left behind. It was the first time I thought I could end someone's life. I'm extremely grateful for the fact that I didn't, but I know I shouldn't see him anywhere ever again. I try to calm myself by saying he's using drugs every day since he was like 14 yo, so in his brain he must be still a child who doesn't get it, due to development delay. But more often than not these calming thoughts don't work. He has very narcissistic tendencies. And saying I hate him would be an absolute understatement. I do get therapy now though. So I wonder whether I would be able to get to that level ever again. I guess not.""
 
 To put things in perspective: Normally I'm a shy and polite person. I never insult others, because I hate hurting them. People will even tell me I lack confidence actually and I should ""stand up for myself more.""
 
 So yeah, to end this long rant with the clear questions I started it with: ""There are different levels to experiencing anger. I was wondering, what are yours? And how do you express it? What's a healthy way you found to cool it down?""","Mental Distress, Mood Tracking, Seeking Help",medium

So I ve been exercising in I think the most unhealthy I can So at just the start no I don t use drugs or steroids or have anorexia I m talking mentally so with that outta the way let s get on with it P S info for the story I m competitive year and I have a long distance girlfriend I ve been with for almost months and I use way too many commas so please forgive me So I m British and my school is right next to the Thames this means we rowing as a sport Throughout year and I always wanted to row so when year rolled around and I was finally the minimum age I could be I jumped right into it I was never an athletic kid hell no I wasn t fat I was unpopular not stand out and to put it simply below average in grades physically and probably in terms of mental health too I was very unpopular being the first kid to hit puberty at to so I was taller than others but still physically very unfit Now one thing that got me into rowing was that fact I was tall At I was approaching foot and fast One thing they don t tell you about ergo machines is that height matters A LOT I instantly got one of the best scores in the year and then it began I was launched from the background right into the spotlight I was suddenly madly competitive and mildly popular and I wanted to be the best So I was Throughout all of year nine I ground my body as hard as I could to have the body I wanted Our year was also the year where the Thames was overflowing our dock quite a bit we had about sessions in the entire year on the water the rest on the machines My body was exhausted but I wasn t eventually nearing the end of the year I managed to pull a split on metres This was a BIG deal I d beat my goal I beat metres in less than seconds to be exact My first ever time took seconds over a fifth higher I was the top of the leaderboard all day every day and my confidence showed it I felt like a king Then Covid happened Immediately I had a problem my gym wouldn t let me in even with no lockdown cause I m under and I had no ergo so we had to get one A concept was preferred as it s industry standard Cut weeks into the future and I ve nearly lost quid of my dad s money to a scam of a concept but i have the new RW NordickTrack Rowing Machine delivered by the lovely Amazon Good Great I was back But then Covid stayed my motivation slipped and I became lazy I was a tragedy if you ever saw one I was doing barely anything and my body was paying for it I was slipping from day to day of online school feeling awful and having my body go down in quality all the while But I got on with it I got back into it and I pushed my body past my limit until I got back So I feel great going back I grin to my friends as I mount the ergo and prepare to brake another of my records at the front of the pack in my arena I felt unstoppable My score was below average pitiful considering how i was and way below what I wanted expected and needed to be in the top boat By now the sport consumed me but rejected me I was getting mediocre scores and everyone else was soaring Cut about a month and I m kicked from top boat Just realized writing this forgot to say I was a year when I came back and we had a new coach she hates me She kicks me from top boat and I m crushed shaking from disappointment in myself and suddenly I m pushed back into the background I didn t matter once again I was paired with the people who wouldn t focus but in boats with people never having rowed before Wanna know the worst bit I could see the top boat speeding away from us any time I looked to my right we were finally on the river and this is how it was Now we re in lockdown again and I m determined I can t let that happen again or so I think right before I get on the ergo once more and feel a painful rash spread across my whole body So it turns out for a few months I ve had a condition where whenever my blood gets to hot or something that s when it effects me worst I break out into a rash I was struggling once more thinking it was just hayfever I struggled through each session it got worse and worse I now have medication an antihistamine to be exact fexofenadine hydrochloride to stop it Great back to it So my school is private and most of the kids have mansions and one guy I know has a gym the size of most of my house so I m at a disadvantage competitively and I ve been doing this for one and a half years when these people have been swimming competitively in their pools for most of their lives But I got too it and I m getting better with my body and I m getting better scores until there it is my name My name in gold I got the fastest score for a kilometre race in the year Remember how I said Concept s are industry standard Well that means my coach who once again dislikes me had to change my scores to be accurate To do this I sent her my average watts produced per metres a measurement which adds with to my score in a concept conversion to per metres and I did it in the km this doesn t add up if you check since it s just an average watt count but the timer didn t lie I d done it This did not matter A split second in a race does And so does my split score As I said before I beat in seconds My coach added seconds to every split I did from my home ergo and my name was wiped from the leaderboard no matter what the watt count said I was pushed forced back down I went from the best score to one of the worst Now seconds is a LOT of time and that s for each metres so instead of my original score I was forced to put up with a score of seconds slower than the original So now what do I know I can t beat anything at home now I can simply train my body for when I go back to be best again The seconds thing was weeks ago about As I mentioned I have a girlfriend she s incredible we don t see each other much and we mostly text and she was getting concerned about the strain I ve been putting on my body But I ve been insecure about everything for too long I can t handle not getting back up there I need it I crave it I was born to row I know it So I ve been doing the worst thing I can I ve lied to her Multiple times I say I m going to bed but I stay up going as hard as I physically can no longer bound by my condition Even as I write this it s AM and she thought I went to sleep at I need help I can t stop I can t keep doing this to her I feel terrible My body is sore and aching and I can t lie to her anymore it s awful I need suggestions on what to do I can t put her through me complaining more and more I can t stay down in rowing and I need to get back up I m ready to row again

"attend a business trip while starting new medication tldr i should be going on a business trip for 4 days with a colleague tomorrow and started new medication bupropione 2 days ago im really stressing out about the trip and dont know whether to got or not
 
 so i have very bad health anxiety since the february similar problems years ago but thats another story probably due to stress since im moving in another country for work next month stress gives me tension headaches and that leads to me thinking i have brain cancer and whatnot
 
 however since march im in a small startup until end of next month for the next funding round we got a business trip this week one of our ceos couldnt attend since shes busy otherwise therefore i am the only option left to go with our other ceo and also a friend of mine since 3 years the organizer specifcally required two people and one is not enough for whatever reason 
 
 i was really stressing out about this since small meeting directly put me into fight or flight lately last week i made a spontaneous visit at a psychiatrist who describwd me 150mg bupropione he told me side effects are not very relevant and i should start right away rather than wait for the business trip to be over the medication relieved my depression but anxiety is unchanged and i wake up at night with panic 
 
 like this i really just dont want to go on a business trip but canceling everything would mean that my colleague has to go alone 
 
 i cant decide what to do disappoint my colleagues and cringe because i have to tell them about my mental health issues or suffer really hard for a few days hoping i get no major panic attacks

Pushed away the girl I loved She was the only person that made me happy Since then it s been a downhill My weight makes anything near impossible I m put down everyday I m just struggling with life Hello I m a long time lurker here and after an argument I just had with my mom I feel I need to share my story and convey my emotions It s gonna be a long one sorry Thank you to anyone who does infact take the time to read my story I m going to start by saying I m years old and have been battling depression for the past ish years I m a pretty big guy for my age st about lb I grew up independently cooking for myself and being young obviously cooking meals for myself which just weren t healthy at all in large portion sizes which have lead to me being the weight I am now I remember the days in school when I used to run m and enjoy all types of sports and now I can t do any of that at all Towards my GCSEs in school was when the depression started I had friends who would bully me make jokes about my weight thinking I was okay with it I wasn t It hurt inside I started skipping school and sleeping a lot that was my life for a good while However I started speaking to a girl in my year still not sure how that happened maybe she just felt bad for me We were just friends but spoke to each other everyday We d FaceTime each other for hours and just talk watch films together anything really This was the first girl who d actually taken the time with me and the first person I d ever really spoken to about personal things like my relationship with my dad I ended up falling in love with this girl because of how she treated me the only issue she liked my friend She d speak about him when we was on the phone together and I was jealous I could never say anything though we were just friends in her eyes As much as I loved this girl and how she listened to me I couldn t tell her how I felt and ended up pushing her away the biggest mistake of my life She was the one person in life who made me happy and I ruined that This happened a week after I finished school ready to start the next venture of my life I had the whole summer to enjoy myself but began to just stay in isolate myself and eat I did this for weeks It was coming to the end of summer and I had to apply somewhere whether that be a job an apprenticeship or college I waited until the very last minute and then joined college In all fairness college was great I met a bunch of new friends who I related to and enjoyed my time but the stress of assignments due in quickly added to my depression I finally spoke to a new friend who had faced depression in the past about how I was feeling who convinced me to speak to someone I spoke to a mental health nurse who was supposedly helping me She d speak to me over the phone for like minutes asking how I was each week and had booked me in for a session with a therapist the only thing being there was a huge wait like months to see one so she advised I d be put on anti depressants I was on mg of Citalopram for months I feel these were good for me I felt good and they were helping especially with the stress of college I was able to finish my college course with a pass and enjoyed myself over the summer it was a good time I have now started my second year at college being unable to find a job or an apprenticeship being rejected at every chance I saw this was my option for the year I decided by myself I should come off my Citalopram and did so without consulting anyone This was a bad decision Everything was fine for a week or so and then everything started coming back I feel depressed again and I m stressing out over little things My weight doesn t help either I have to catch a bus into the city where my college is which takes like minutes and then a minute walk This is fine but whatever I am wearing and whatever the weather I sweat abnormally either due to my weight or some issue that I don t know of yet It s the most embarrassing and uncomfortable thing I constantly feel like crap turning up to college or just walking around and being sweaty I could try and lose the weight but through my depression I m just not motivated even though I know I need to lose this weight The depression has gotten to the point where I m now experiencing suicidal thoughts I can t live with how unhealthy I am It kills me everyday I need a solution which is ultimately to lose weight but I just can t I honestly feel like I m going to kill myself soon either by eating myself to death or actual suicide because of this I just don t know what to do I thank you for reading my post didn t really know what to write or how to write and lay it out but however jumbled up my post is it was good to write this for my sake as someone that rarely speaks about their issues I d also like to thank everyone hear that offers their voice and helps out people that post their feelings here everyday whilst I am hear It s definitely helped me sometime looking at posts and seeing how people help each other Thank you,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update, Seeking Help",high

How I feel The story I m not like most people I m special Special doesn t mean better It doesn t mean worse Only different At first sight I look normal I act normal But I did figure out that I wasn t and it only took me two decades So my situation s a little different than others here I didn t live through a traumatic event when I was a kid according to me My parents didn t beat me Didn t get bullied too much I m not in pain I don t feel alone even though I am I didn t have a best friend when I was a kid It wasn t a health problem so I didn t talk about it to my physician And when I felt anxious well everyone else did too Nothing strange there either a kid was stressed or didn t give a shit I talked about my feelings just as much as the next guy which is not at all I could be wrong there since I didn t have a best friend It all seemed pretty normal to me It was pretty normal to be stressed and to not give a shit And I could do both Fast forward a little and it becomes obvious that I m not normal In my early twenties my friends were my co workers I had started smoking to cope with the stress Random people had earned my respect for coping with stress without that crutch Going out once a month is definitely not normal Not having friends is not normal Not seeing your parents for months in a row is not normal It made me different Not better not worse I had already thought about killing myself briefly During I kid you not an insurance meeting with the HR department She did the math in front of me not exactly challenging I had to work another something years to get full retirement benefits At the time I thought I could do it I was let go about years later I didn t think about my mental health issues for some time Eventually I did my own research to find out relevant details I m reasonably certain that I also have alexithymia lack of emotional self awareness and anhedonia inability to feel pleasure It s always easier to spot a problem in retrospect but it explains a lot Why I don t miss people when they re gone Why I don t cry at funerals Why I rarely get angry Why I never knew what to ask for on my birthdays I don t form emotional bond with people There s no one in my life to whom I can say with certainty I love you A blank space is a list of every thing I want My whole life has been driven by what I don t want I don t want to stand out I don t want to be unemployed I don t want to be homeless I don t want to live I don t want to walk around aimlessly choc full of antidepressant Don t want to work years in a daze Don t want to get stuck in a psych ward Don t want to get worse Things aren t bad for me They re not good either I can t remember the best day of my life Can t remember the worst either But I do remember some bad ones I don t want to kill myself but I think I ll do it anyway,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update",high

I tried to kill myself the other nightI don t really know how to talk about this Right now my kids are playing and being cute and the conflict of disgust for myself at my attempt to leave them and the disgust that they deserve someone better than their shit mommy is mingled up I feel sick because I haven t eaten again too But it doesn t make a difference I m still fat I m not losing weight My attempt was as pathetic and stupid as I am I tried to run outside naked in degree snowy weather and throw myself into water I didn t even make it outside My husband wrestled me to the ground first while I was screaming like a banshee The bruises are a reminder of how pathetic I am I ve been married for six years I ve been in a poly relationship with my boyfriend for four Ex boyfriend Yeah look at the drama queen having a breakdown over her worthless ex My husband is an INTJ He loves me deeply but he s terrible at showing it He s very neurotic read the wikipedia article for Neuroticism and you ve got his biography He s also the male equivalent of a nymphomaniac His upbringing was conservative Christian style abusive and he reacts in a volatile manner to almost everything I m ESFJ I try to keep everyone happy but I guess I m shit at it I rarely clean because I m always tired Keeping him calm when the kids lose it is a strain Keeping myself calm when the kids lose it is a strain Some days I just can t anymore Those are the days we fight He loves me he works very hard for our family I just feel very lonely and not understood Or that he even tries to understand He just wants the fight to stop but also to win it To explain to me with anger skewed logic how I m wrong nomatter what in the heat of a fight When not in a fight he still doesn t know how to do things make me happy even though we ve been married for six years Even though I know how to make him happy I ve tried to tell him sweet things to try he ll do it for a day or two then forget I feel so lonely At some point I d started cutting but rarely Maybe once every few months then a year or two between Four years ago my husband had had a girlfriend on Second Life for awhile and I d been ok with it our marriage had been rocky and it kept him from harassing me for sex so much He had encouraged me to talk to guys there too I met my boyfriend by roleplaying on Second Life and the connection was instantaneous and intense We talked for hours and hours and hours the first few days He understood me the way he thought made sense We had the same interests liked the same games liked the same themes My husband was jealous that we had so much in common but he was getting a lot more sex so he didn t complain much My boyfriend was my social life I told him everything though I told him too much so many times its probably what killed it at some point or another We moved around a lot so I wasn t able to meet up with him until the very end of those four years Well after he was already over me though he always said that he loved me We kept moving then I got pregnant He was sure I d disappear but I didn t No one would hire me pregnant I became a stay at home mother before I even had the baby Childcare would cost the same as me working my ass off at part time jobs just to pay for someone else to raise my children for me My husband hurried and got a job in NYC and we moved to a shitty part of NJ when I was months pregnant The birth was traumatic for me the doctors were horrible to me and bullied me into a cesarean I probably didn t need The new baby was colicky and miserable My husband s job was hell the commute was hell I was alone all day with a miserable baby and my online boyfriend Then the job cut everyone s already spectacularly low pay down by We lost our apartment I had to move in with his control freak hyper conservative christian mother borderline fundamentalist My husband had to move in with a friend for a longer commute for shit pay while the new boss they assigned when the old one quit screamed at his three person department in front of the entire office He had sleep apnea and wasn t sleeping He was in hell His mother is a hoarder I was crammed in a tiny basement filled to the ceiling with bullshit and an extreme mold problem that made everyone sick I had my tiny miserable colicky baby down there while failing at breastfeeding and was in pumping hell He would cry all night and refuse to eat and I had to be chained to a breast pump I was supposed to be illustrating a children s book I hated I eventually finished it but it took months and I still don t like looking at it Talking to Seth was hell I needed help and relief and so did he and we had none to give We would be snappy and miserable at each other So I stopped talking to him My boyfriend was the only thing that got me through it I talked to him a ridiculous amount I was nocturnal to avoid a large portion of everyone s unending stress and talked to him while I tried to work He loved me then dearly He got so much attention and we would spend hours and hours talking and roleplaying and just being together It was unrealistic Then my husband would make the hour long commute to our apartment from work on fridays then the three hour commute to his parents to get there around pm He would be tired and angry and snappy He didn t want to look at the baby We would almost always fight He was miserable and I was miserable and he was jealous He didn t have his girlfriend anymore It was the ugliest time in our relationship It was the ugliest time in my life except for now I think Eventually he quit the hell job and we immediately moved in with my parents because living with his was hell on earth My boyfriend didn t manage well Suddenly that constant attention was pulled I couldn t be on calls much at all I had less childcare and I was severely depressed My husband jealously tried to keep me away from the computer too after I had abandoned him for my boyfriend those six months It was rocky For awhile my boyfriend railed against it fought to have me back like we were before Even if my husband hadn t be jealous that could never happen Not without leaving my husband and through it all I didn t want to I still loved him He couldn t ask me to but I know my boyfriend wished I would Its a natural selfish thing we all do I d been unfair and told him things I shouldn t have told him when I was hurt and when I was angry with my husband It wasn t business to share I d planted strife between them I d always held this naive belief that my boyfriend would love me forever He d pulled away gotten a lot more quiet He didn t respond to everything I said anymore instead I d be writing pages to myself That was around two years in My husband got a job a new job in Pittsburgh We moved for the fifth time in the years I d known my boyfriend We got an apartment I wanted to fly him up but money was tight from all the moving and we were behind on everything Also having a yr old toddler was tough and my relationship was still strained with my husband My boyfriend was around probably out of the same lonliness I was suffering from We were making plans to meet Then I found out I was pregnant again A failed IUD that had been put in incorrectly Who knows if I d been unprotected for a year or if it had moved somehow I ll never know It was dangerous They tried to get me to abort immediately just to be safe but I refused I had to be monitored for a month to make sure I wasn t in danger of ectopic pregnancy Once I was out of danger my boyfriend became cynical and distant He was sneaking around on Second Life with random people e clubs He still played games with me and playing some Warhammer roleplaying games with him and friends revived it a bit I tried to fly him up but became violently ill with morning sickness and he cancelled the flight when I said I couldn t do it I m pretty sure that was the moment it was really over The pregnancy was miserable My husband doesn t do well with small children at all Baby cries make him panic and respond unreasonably and he constantly talked about how awful it would be to have a baby and a toddler together Even though I talked throughout the day every single day my boyfriend was also distant and uncaring He d offhandedly mentioned meeting a girl but her husband had been so jealous it only lasted a couple of days I wasn t carrying a baby it seemed I was carrying a nuclear bomb It was a long lonely miserable pregnancy I cried so much When the baby finally came I had to have another cesarean this time because I d been sitting in a shitty broken chair for years that screwed up the alignment of my pelvis It was my fault You can t have a trip with a new baby You can t have your boyfriend up when your body is shitty and you re breastfeeding While family is constantly in and out While my life was hell At least I d thought so I should ve just let him in I m practical to a fault but I don t think he was even that interested at that point We still talked every day We played games together I tried to make it through my lonely stressful life I held onto him and he was sort of there but I railed against the distance that was so plain Finally we made plans The baby was finally old enough to stay away for a few days We would get together at Anthrocon in Pittsburgh where we live My husband s girlfriend would come up to meet him too a girl he wasn t much into anymore either but wanted to give a chance Just weeks before the trip my boyfriend had a heart attack It was the true end because when he wrote about it on his FA and that girl from before attached herself to him He began talking to her constantly more than me Roleplaying with her doing all the things he did with me when our relationship had been new She was married too She just didn t have children He talked to her for months She began posting pictures of their characters fucking She told me to my e face that it wasn t like that and she respected my relationship meanwhile she wrote all over her tumblr about her new boyfriend I d postponed the trip to October for him to heal It was for two weeks It was pleasant but he was distant and had issues making love to me He spent a lot of time on his phone The second week my husband s girlfriend came up and there was trick or treat and I took the kids to zoo boo and a hallow birthday party for my boyfriend and a friend of mine It was chaotic and my husband had a breakdown because he didn t know how to deal with the jealousy but felt too guilty to leave his girlfriend for long enough to get comfort for me We had a fight where we had to talk it out It was awkward The rest of the trip was ok but the second week was stressful and messy I d made a bad choice in timing and by adding the girlfriend It was too much At Christmas I found out that they were together She posted pictures of her and her husband and him all nude in their furry forms cuddling together I got very upset Then I got dumped I cried I was told at first that I had been chosen The pictures came down We got each other Christmas gifts Then they all reappeared And he chose her I spiraled It was the worst Christmas of my life I spent hours on the phone with him The first few times were sweet and caring Eventually he couldn t keep the facade up anymore He plastered her on his profile immediately I cut myself Five stripes to numb the drowning feeling At some point before then I d figured out that a clean razor stored in a sterile bottle would cut cleanly enough to give me a dose of adrenaline that would numb an episode of drowning It wouldn t make me feel good but it would get my head above water until I just existed in a cold lonely world instead of drowning in a chaotic whirlpool of hurt I took a break from the computer Stopped taking commissions and withdrew to try to get through the holiday I bought a bunch of games on steam and spent a lot of time playing them with my husband He was happy to have me back and since I wasn t outwardly being miserable he assumed I was all better A month of back and fourth with my boyfriend still trying to play games together but his platitudes wearing thin and his promises falling through again and again Then she posts about how he had visited her In November Immediately after seeing me I d been cheated on in the flesh I found out about a week and a half ago I called him I cried a little but I was mostly numb He didn t sound very sorry about it I told him if he wanted me around he would have to talk to me He said he would He barely tried I cut again Four stripes to breathe Then a few days later he leaves to go see her He s at her house right now Fucking her I was stupid I kept looking at his profile on FA As long as things weren t being posted maybe it was going badly Then the flood of blissfully happy images appeared He knew I was following him so even if I hadn t been checking they all flooded my feed I doubt I even crossed his mind when he did it Imagine if someone got a divorce then a month later when his ex found out she d been cheated on he starts plastering his facebook with images of him and his new gf together It was the final blow I ve never felt so ugly so fat so useless in my life or so alone My artwork is constantly surpassed by others and its my own fault for not spending more time on it The time I do spend is away from my children My house is a shitpile because I don t clean When he posted all that I went upstairs upset and sad I was angry and tired I told him what happened and he scolded me for looking at his profile I snapped I told him to say loving words or to shut the fuck up He didn t like it he kept shoving his advice down my throat and I got more and more hysterical I ran downstairs I ve threatened suicide so many times in my hysteria during our echo chamber fights he didn t even follow Then I slammed the silverware drawer and he angrily yelled down at me and ran downstairs I told him to fuck off He tore into me verbally I tore back We worked each other up until I was done I was betrayed and heartfucked by one asshole and would be spending a life with the other who would never ever be able to lick my wounds to actually care Just fucking correct until I gave in I ran for the door I was naked I tried to get it open but he stopped me I ran for the other He stopped me again I ran a third time and got it halfway open he overpowered me and wrestled me to the floor while I screamed and screamed He held me down until I gave up I should ve gone to the hospital but I didn t He stayed home the next day to make sure I wouldn t do anything I asked my ex to call me he said he would then he didn t I m not worth it I m not worth bothering with I m not worth figuring out what I need because why bother on a fat waste of air I m so sad Sorry for the life story It doesn t really tell that my husband is a good person that my boyfriend was too He said so many sweet things but his actions do a lot to prove how false they were That my kids are smart and beautiful but extremely stressful Some days I don t know how to keep going The house is getting steadily more disgusting I m getting snappy

Getting to be too muchI gave up on the antidepressants I was taking about half a year ago because they made certain parts of my life dull and numb and at the time I was in a long distance relationship with a girl who was great at understanding my problems and making me feel like she genuinely cared about me About a month or so ago she broke up with me without warning two weeks before we had plans to meet because she had met someone else and she couldn t be with me anymore Obviously this hurt me and left me scrambling and aimless but I ve been doing my best not to let it dominate me and trying to pick myself back up I switched to new antidepressants a week ago because I ve been slipping worse and worse and thinking suicidal thoughts for hours every night at work or home This morning it got so bad I looked up information on my antidepressants in order to find out if I could overdose on them and I ve thought about it four or five times since then I think I m still okay because I haven t tried anything yet and the antidepressants haven t had enough time to do their work but it s scaring me more and more Look I know everyone s got relationship troubles and I know it hurts like hell I know my problems aren t special and I can t pretend they are But I ve struggled my whole life with relationships I m and I haven t been intimate with anyone And every time I get close to someone friend or romantic interest they push me away Every person I ve called a best friend cut contact with me Every romantic interest despite what they would say were not willing to actually be with me I don t know why It became a fear of mine being abandoned by people I cared about and my ex was wonderful to me for many reasons but she alleviated that fear She actually got through my depression and made me feel cared about and I felt really healthy and like I was making progress because of her And then to just be cut off again without warning to have her do to me exactly what I was afraid of happening despite knowing I was afraid of that it s like none of that healthiness and happiness mattered I mean I was suicidal before but now I don t know how much more I can take I still have immediate goals but it s becoming excruciating to get through day after day like this I just want to get over it to not feel like such a fucking failure with people and with myself and focus on other goals for now but I m not letting myself I just want to have someone close to me again I just want to feel like someone cares again Half the reason I m writing this is to just get it out of my system I think it worked because I m crying hahaha but thank you if you took the time to read it Some words of encouragement would mean the world to me but don t feel pressured to say anything Thank you so much,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update, Seeking Help",high

Concerned for a friend our conversation has left me shaken up I want to start from the beginning I apologize early on if the information is not needed I will try to get to our conversation that just happened a few minutes ago quickly Sorry if the formatting and paragraphing is weird I play online video games quite a lot This has led me to meet plenty of people who come in and out of my life a lot Except for one of my friends who we will call James We have talked and played together for a little over a year now This has caused a pretty good relationship to grow between us We text call each other and even video chat on the occasion James is and lives in another state than I Because we have grown so close we talk a lot about things that happen in real life and about our pasts He mentioned to me that he has attempted suicide before but was saved and generally during our relationship he was never depressed or has ever shown any signs that he is still feeling like killing himself It all started a about months ago when he got together with this woman they dated for a few weeks and he made her pretty happy He often makes the mistake of falling to quickly and deeply in love When they broke up he was very depressed the only time we would ever talk was when he was completely intoxicated We went through a period where he would never answer calls or texts from me even Finally some good things happened in his life that brought him up and we were talking again Just weeks ago he decided to try dating again He met a girl via a dating app They talked non stop which made him smile and laugh and REALLY made a difference in him that even I could see from a few states away They met each other in person as she only lived an hour away from him and everything was going great He was talking about how much he loved her I don t know if he told her that and how she could be the one he marries I didn t want to ruin his fun as it was nice to see him happy so I did not say anything to him about how soon it was to make statements like that They broke up yesterday He had text me very early in the morning when I was sleeping and I didn t get the text for another hours All it said was I need someone right now I felt terrible because somehow I knew what happened I gave him a call no answer I text him no answer so I called him again and he answered saying he was at a friends getting drunk I asked if he was okay and he explained to me what happened They broke up because her mom told her she didn t want them to be together He pretty much hung up on me so I decided to give him space as he clearly didn t want to talk about it Today when I asked him if he wanted to play any games I didn t want to bug him about what happened He said he would so we got on and played for about minutes before he left to go play a different game After a few hours he called and sounded extremely intoxicated He asked to play so I hopped on the game and joined him I asked him if he was drunk he said he was I could tell This is where it gets to our conversation I asked why he was drinking so much he explained that he has felt like he was having a heart attack all day and yesterday He was slurring his speech making incoherent sentences etc Then he very casually says he wants to blow his brains out It took me by surprise and I asked him why He says he was in pain saying that he wants to end it so he no longer feels how he is anymore I got more and more concerned as he spoke I had no idea what to say I know for a fact that he has the means and intent to do something like that so I asked him if he was serious why he was going to do it He said he was serious and said he wanted to end his pain and that he didn t deserve to live anymore I tried to tell him that I care about him and that I would miss him his family and friends would etc Anything I could think of to say to him He just shot everything down saying he hates everyone and that his family and friends including me could fuck off and go to hell because he will be dead and won t have to deal with the consequences of his death I pretty much was left crying my eyes out left not knowing what to say All I could say was your life matters to me and I would be upset if you died After repeatedly saying he didn t care he finally says do you think if I was actually going to kill myself I would be sitting here talking to you No i wouldn t be He basically started to lash out against me and I had nothing left to say He had shrugged off anything I could think of to say Right now I am heading off to work and said he could call me and I would talk to him if he needed or wanted to talk He didn t respond and just logged off of the game Hasn t answered my texts or calls It s not my fault I have to go to work and can t listen to him calling me a whore for the rest of the night But I did offer to listen while I was at work I honestly have no idea what to do anymore I m not sure how serious his threats were and I have no idea where he lives no contact other than his cell phone number I don t know if I should reach out to his family members on Facebook or if that would cause more damage,"Cause of Distress, Critical

i m all out of hopesorry if this doesn t make much sense i m sort of in the middle of a breakdown and i don t know what i m going to do i m depressed like really depressed it comes and goes but it s been a steady downward path before i got depressed i was a promising student at a world famous university now i m no longer in school unemployed keep getting rejected living with roommates at least one of whom hates me i am running out of money and relying on my parents even though i m an adult and i dont have a whole lot of food in my apt right now but i can t bring myself to do all the work of showering putting on clean clothes bundling up and walking to the store shopping carrying it all home putting everything away cooking something and then cleaning up directly afterwards or else my roommate will get mad at me i dont have the money to keep ordering out it s also very cold in my apt and i think that s really starting to drive me crazy i m also struggling with my gender and sexuality and i really really hate it i hate being queer that s not the only reason i m depressed but its constantly getting worse and its just one more thing i don t need to be dealing with right now i m trying i ve been trying i m now on ssri and at this point the only noticable effect is a shitton of memory loss i go to therapy i ve quit drinking i m even on meds for hypothyroid and i had some hope they might help my mood as well but right now looking back it seems things are only steadily getting worse the bottom line SW is that i cannot live the rest of my life like this every day i lose hope that it s going to go away because it seems to me like i m doing everything i can when things first got bad it was somewhat easy for me to tell myself it wasnt going to last forever but it s been years guys years and it s only gotten worse and i m no longer seeing the point i lived the best years of my life up to about age and since then i might as well be dead i wanted to be this amazing fucking scientist but now that doesn t even seem worth it even if i do somehow crawl out of this pit and become successful i don t even care if i still have to feel like this i thought maybe there was something wrong with me and all my doctors would figure it out eventually but now i m starting to think maybe i just cant handle being an adult and i m doomed to either live like this for the rest of my life or take the chance that there s something better on the other side i dont know i m scared i dont want to die but i m getting to the point where i refuse to live this way much longer i can t do it and i wont can someone just give me some hope that the rest of my life isnt going to be this way it s been so long and i m out of hope do you all have any you could spare,"Cause of Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Mental Distress, Mood Tracking, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help",medium

Apathetic towards life Basically I m going through an intense existential crisis Can t sleep because I m thinking constantly about the meaningless and futility of human existence and the fact that nothing that humans treasure in this world actually means anything to me and that I would be equally as fulfilled spending the rest of my life in a small room living on bowls of rice as I would living the mundane life of the average American forming superficial relationships with other and climbing the corporate ladder until I either save up enough money to retire and play bingo with other dying people buy a beachfront property like one of those snooty rich white people you see on HGTV or be like the average american and work until I meet my inevitable death Even if I become a doctor the lives I save are going to end anyway Even if I become a politician whatever country I try to save is going to crumble eventually anyway Even if I become a writer my words will be lost someday and one day every trace of humanity s existence will be wiped out and forgotten Literally the only thing I can think of that I would dream of doing would be to travel the world and see as much of it as I can but even the excitement of that is being stamped out by the constant overflowing of information on the internet about the world Why save a shit ton of money to travel to Japan when you could go online and look at pictures read travel blogs listen to their music on youtube do a bunch of other stuff that effectively would ruin the excitement of your life experience There are so many people better of than you that you can just live vicariously through and even if you don t frequent the internet very often you re still bound to at some point feel like you re experiencing some form of sensory overload with the media constantly in you face all the goddamn time Everything just feels like it s already been said and done and I m pretty honestly bored with life,"Cause of Distress, Positive Coping",medium

I can t pretend anymore tl dr my roommate is an asshole who is no longer content with the agreement we made when I moved in with him keeps threatening to ship me back to my abusive mother who I moved in with him to get away from in the first place and instead of telling me something as important as our financial aid got cut off last night when it happened waited until we were fighting this morning to yell it at me and then blame me because of all the stress he s under And it s making me feel like actually killing myself for the first time in over a decade The long version I m clearly not wanted here I told him point blank when I moved in that I have several diagnosis that label me disabled both physically and mentally and I ve applied for disability twice only to be denied and don t have the funds now to try a third time I told him that I cannot work a regular job so unless he was willing to put his social network here to use since I don t have one and help me find something I wouldn t be able to work We made the agreement that I d be a live in maid and I said hell yeah and have been keeping up my end of the deal ever since But in these past months he s clearly grown tired of that He says my disabilities are an excuse for me to be lazy He says I could work if I tried but he hasn t been in my shoes The last retail positions I held led to a repeated mental breakdowns in the middle of the store during my shift for things like a customer yelling at me or a co worker being rude and b so much pain that I literally came home cried myself to sleep woke up enough to shower and eat and then go back to work and rinse repeat The short time I had those jobs I was miserable I led a miserable existence and actually contemplated suicide for the first time since about years earlier when I had actually seriously tried twice in a row On top of that I was pretty much given the diagnosis of hey yeah those mental breakdowns are bad for your mental health they worsen my anxiety and depression and oh that pain in your legs and feet means you re over stretching something and if you keep doing that you might end up in a wheelchair forever so no jobs like that if you care about your health But this is my fault right I m giving out excuses I m lazy I deserve to go back to the mother who verbally mentally and emotionally abused me for over years of my life and who according to at least separate therapists I saw is likely the cause of my anxiety and depression in the first place and whose actions caused me to try to kill myself twice in the past I deserve to go back to her even though she made it plain to me that if my roommate ever saw fit to do that I d be homeless because she would bring me home only to kick me out again because she s not supporting me all my life Or maybe I deserve to go into that bathroom in the room next to me lock the door and run a bath in the tub and try again After all my roommate could move back in with his parents if he didn t have to worry about me since they won t take me in too I wouldn t be holding him back anymore like he says all the time I d be one less expense he has to pay and hell maybe he could even sell my stuff for a decent amount and that d buy him enough time to find a job and all that Just like my mom he d be better off I wasn t dragging him down all the time,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update",high

K SO x L fan fiction chill I wrote this half jokingly and it s all in good fun no need for pitchforks This takes place a good while after The Rise of Skywalker and follows the idea that K SO downloads his memory to the other Imperial security droid from HISHE K SO wakes up on a forest surrounded by rusted and mossy debris of what looks like an Imperial ship He stood and saw the tip of the old Rebel base which has been largely devastated after an attack by The Empire He wanders for a bit before finding what looks like a freighter A Correlian YT light freighter what is it doing here He said to himself He stopped before walking any further as he sees that the base is no longer operational and came to two conclusions The Empire won and wiped the Rebel Alliance or an escape was made right after a large battle A large hairy figure spotted him as well as what seemed to be a droid model he s unfamiliar with The figure was carrying a bowcaster and the droid was rolling around as his body was shaped like a ball Do not shoot I mean you no harm K SO shouted I am not part of the Empire despite what my appearance would tell you The figure shrieks and K SO found out that it was a wookie It may be impolite of me but I do not understand Shyriiwook He exclaimed in a half joking manner One thing led to another and after a ripped arm caused by a Wookie tantrum he was allowed to enter the freighter named The Millenium Falcon as well as the name of the Wookie Chewbacca with the rolling droid BB being his translator He found out that they are there to wait for a Jedi named Rey who went and take a look at the base as a part of learning the Jedi s past The other two were quick to accept him as the rebel database mentions a suicide mission including a reprogrammed Imperial droid that might or might not survived the battle at Scarif Everything was going well until the Falcon was attacked by a jungle Rancor They rushed inside and make quick work with the large beast but with some significant damage to the ship and BB said to him that it would be nice if he would help to fix the ship I no longer have a master might as well made myself useful He replied After a scan it turns out that the navigation computer system was damaged a bit on the attack and he chose to fix that first as it seemed to be the quickest one to repair He soon realized that the navigation system is like nothing he ever seen with some of the most peculiar dialect He s interested in what seemed to be self awareness as he never seen another droid expressed such way of thinking for a navigation system He proceeds to connect the computer to his head using a cable to interact with it in a more face to face way My name is K SO I just fix the navigation computer and now I am interested in the self awareness of this system He exclaimed to the abyss You you re like me A faint sound of a female is heard I am sorry I do not know what you re talking about and I know the difference between a droid and a navigation system He replied I am L I am a droid own who was a partner of Lando Calrissian and had been this ship s navigation computer for most of my existence I am disgusted on how I and droids across the galaxy is treated The voice said and you showed up having the same level of awareness as me She continued I am sorry to inform you but my self awareness comes from the result of my reprogramming and I m sure that you achieved the same thing from a similar method He answers it is not true awareness Oh it s awareness alright the way you decided to fix me first without asking the only living thing on this ship the way you decided to plug yourself in without other people telling you to as well as your distinct personality L replied That is not true I was taking initiative by my own I see your point He said They chatted for a good while and even went into a heated argument about droid rights but ended up passive aggressivelly agreeing with each other s views Hey thanks for fixing me and talking to me it s been a long time since I get to talk to another person She said Do not mention it I plug myself into this ship and I have no one to blame but myself for getting berated by another droid He replied Shut up She said in a sarcastic tone promise me that you ll send my message to droids across the galaxy She continued I do not see how they could have self awareness from your message as the chance of that happening is at most but I will send them to other droids He assured her He unplugged himself from the computer Well now I have job to do He said to himself,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk",high

Should I quit my job and end it all A little background I m a year old guy diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder who recently started therapy and am going to start group I work as a retail cashier and nearly every other coworker is around my age I feel like I have a pretty good albeit superficial relationship with everyone I m a mostly quiet but sometimes bubbly and energetic guy Myself and my manager who is only are pretty close especially as we discuss our anxiety with each other A few months ago I started crushing hard on a new coworker and asked her out only to find out she s already in a relationship On the outside I say it s cool and we remain friends but on the inside I m devastated I romanticized her put her on a pedal She was the one and if we started dating all my problems and low self esteem would go away Because I mean if this amazing person told me they loved me then surely I d never feel bad again So in a fit of all these feelings I jokingly told my manager I wanted to kill this girl s boyfriend I was obviously joking and my manager laughed along I even told my manager I wasn t actually thinking that and that I was just hurt So I have an intense fear of social rejection I m paranoid that everyone around me is talking behind my back making fun of me and purposely not inviting me out This stems from experiences and believes from my abuser in middle and high school Then an incident in college where I confided in a friend about my suicidality lead them to shaming me and telling the rest of our class leading to them ostracizing me So me being open with my feelings has bit me in the ass a great number of times So today I ended up working with the coworker I had a crush on and she asks me if I ve been talking behind her back That she s heard from a lot of people that I m obsessed with her and want to kill her boyfriend I am able to explain that I only told our manager as a joke and that I shouldn t have said that and she seemed to be okay with that But now I know the truth That my manager who I confided in told my secrets to everyone else and they are actually making fun of me behind my back I have caused my worst fears to come true So now I have a decision should I quit my job which I ve always hated and wanted to quit anyway or realize that I m overreacting about the situation I don t work tomorrow so I m thinking of calling in and quitting by the phone without giving any reason why I just want to make this one phone call and never think about that place ever again I m currently living with my family so I only have car payments and a few bills every month But to be honest I just want to quit my job release my album and then kill myself I don t want another job another chance at embarrassment another chance at failure another chance at ruining everything I m just so damn tired and I don t care about my life anymore Or maybe I m just overreacting I can t tell,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update",high

"47 y/o male. Divorced. In stable relationship now - finally. 
 
 While visiting my parents this weekend, I opened a box which contained painful memories. One was so many letters and cute things from my courtship with my ex-wife and mother of my child. I’ve been able to come to a place where I don’t fully blame myself for the end of my marriage. I get that it was both of us, only I did the acting out. Of course.
 
 What is more painful tonight is that my mom kept every letter my college ex girlfriend wrote me. Reading back, it’s so easy to see the pure love she had that was so hard to see then. She was also the one who took the most emotional abuse, when I was at worst and had absolutely zero self-awareness. All these letters and pics showed a genuinely good person who did not deserve any of what I subjected her to, and that is difficult.
 
 It’s been over 20 years. I since had a 14 year marriage which ended, have a ten year-old son, fell hard, and have gotten up. I have my pain, but I now manage myself better than ever. I have a partner of three years I treat well. I just feel for this woman who so clearly loved me, but got the worst of me, tonight.
 
 We last had contact in about 2005 or 2006. It was still loving and caring, inquiring about each other’s friends and families. I know she has three kids and a good life.I tried an FB message about eight years go which was never read - no assumptions made. I want to say how sorry I am. She loved me so goddamn much, but I also don’t see the use. The right thing is to cherish what I have and not repeat this a third time in my life.","Mood Tracking, Progress Update",medium

I JUST WANNA BE APPRECIATED a month ago i asked a nice girl in our hich school to get to know me not dating but as friends she told me politely no because our values were different i had waited a long time to ask her to meet me after school because i thought she was nice and everything i knew we had some different opinions but that s not really a problem because my best friends have the exact opposite opinions than i do i was really disappointed when she told me she didnt want to get to know me so this happened today my yr half brother was drinking in a bigger city and needed money because he had no place to go but had money for drinking with friends he and his mom and sister messaged and called me several times and asked me to borrow some money i told i could pay his bus ticket if he wanted to go home and he refused i told them i wont pay a hotel room because i want him to get better and take responsibility they all got mad and my brother said he wont be helping me in the future and then hang up he doesnt respect me at all and only calls when needs money i dont have good relationship with my parents either they dont really appreciate me and my dad once almost killed me a few years ago i just want to be loved im trying to fix our relationship but they make it hard sometimes and then a girl who goes the same high school as i do but is not following me on social media just messaged me and asked if she can ask something personal related to my religion then i just thought okay i dont give a sh t anymore and i wrote a LONG message to her explaining how people only think im this boring religious person and nothing more and im not and i told her i was used to bullied at school and that people at school didnt know how hard my personal life was i told her that i am religious but my best friends are not i am religious but i do other things as well than just read the Bible and so when she had read what i wrote she just told me i shouldnt tell people how i feel probably she was right but i thought she would say something else everything what i had just told her was forgotten and she didnt say anything about it she only asked the question and i answered her the thing is almost everyone almost every person in our school has like friends and are friends with everyone and then there is me i have one friend in our whole student school im thankful i have her but ive always wanted to have many friends and i just dont know how to get them ive tried but no what im saying is that i am way much more than just my religion although it s the most important thing to me and i can be fun and do stuff like sneak from bathroom window at night with my friends or travel to random city and stay at star hotell loose all money and ask strangers to donate me a a few dollars and i like watching cat or duck tiktoks or those tiktoks where people are tell me you are a robot without telling me you are a robot and i love watching netflix hbo disney etc i cry when i think about this world and i pray for people that dont even know i exist i would die for you who are reading this and i am super loyal to my friends i would like more people to acknowledge me im not the best person in the world and im actually pretty stupid and mean sometimes but i can be a true and loving friend if people just wanted go get to know me thank you for reading God bless you btw im a year old girl,"Cause of Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Mental Distress, Positive Coping",medium

I met a guy who loved me despite everything and tried to make me a better person too; he was my shelter and escape everytime my mum hits me with the negative shit. But recently he abandoned me and left me to fend for myself and he took the light away with him too. Today I signed up for a credit card and was nagged to no end by my mother, and was called stupid over something that I did my research for. And it hit me that things have always been like this since I was young. Everything I do is not right and everything I do is dumb and everything I do has to be controlled by her. And I am so drained.

Help I m having bad thoughts and they scare me I ve never gone to therapy consistently enough to be diagnosed with any kind of mental illness or depression but I remember being sad or dissatisfied most of the time even though for the most part I seem very mellow yet fun loving I ve had things happen in my past and in the recent past as well I ve experienced things that I d never experienced before and a lot of the were negative things I try to smile and be nice to people and do things that I love I ve picked up a few new interests along the way one being science pantheism The more I get into it the more disenchanted I am with humanity It s gotten to the point where I hate people and I think about how much I hate them while I m out in public I have a lot of anxiety about talking to people and I spend a lot of time all by myself I ve also been having lots of suicidal thoughts Like a lot Like multiple times throughout every day Even when I am happy I still think of killing myself I ve had this before but never to this extent and it really scares me The combination of hating people and fantasizing about suicide really seems like a recipe for destruction I don t think that I am capable of hurting anyone and I don t think I m capable of committing suicide but what if these thoughts get worse and I do something I can t take back It might just be that I need to go to therapy and let go of a lot of negative things in my life in my thoughts from my past I don t have anyone I feel safe confiding in all of this Does anyone else know how I feel Am I going crazy,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update, Seeking Help",high

Waking up in the middle of the night weighing up the pros and cons of people caring that I stay alive It s currently Monday morning AM I woke up about two hours ago still half drunk having had about hours sleep ate some more Xanax and smoked more weed I spent most of this weekend in my bed I wanted to go out and do things but one way or another I seemed to convince myself not to I have a good support network which I m extremely grateful The feeling that I have let my family and loved ones down has been fundamental in the way that I have viewed every day since I was or I m now M Significant mental health issues and substance abuse have been ongoing problems for me since then In this time I have continued to meet a few amazing people who have challenged my cynicism about humanity This adds to my conflict Do I want to be here Is me being here of enough benefit to be worth it My dreams and goals are barely worth mentioning anymore because my work towards achieving them has completely stagnated I am no longer sure if I am capable of ever completing my university degree and making the world a slightly better place through my career During the pandemic and recession the government in my country has been providing financial assistance to people who lost their jobs due to the economic circumstances I am one of these people I am very grateful for what has been provided to me but the government money provided to us is about to be reduced and sustaining myself is about to become more difficult unless I can manage to find a new job amp x B Right now I kind of just wish I hadn t woken up in the middle of the night I feel slightly better after crying and writing this but I suspect that this loneliness is about become quite overwhelming again when I finish writing Love of any kind seems to so rarely be a worthwhile investment Is it normal that most of the people who I have loved have either severely betrayed me left or died I know that I m the common link here I know that I get along well with mentally ill people because I m mentally ill but how the fuck do I fix all this I couldn t deal with another loved one dying from drug alcohol overdose or suicide I can t count them on both hands anymore I know there are people in much worse positions but I can t talk to anyone about this stuff and I feel so alone Today was a nice day why am I still like this It s almost am now I wonder if I ll be able to go back to sleep,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Seeking Help",high

Please I need some advice for how to not hate myself Disclaimer I don t think I m like actively suicidal I feel like I m not capable of pulling the trigger myself so to speak yay gallows humor I just haven t felt this awful in a long time and this seems like the best r to ask for help with severe depression and related mental health Also throwaway account Also obviously there s some details missing so that this isn t a novel but I tried to hit everything relevant Where to begin I think I m one of those people who was born already missing my serotonin and the current state of the USA is absolutely not helping it at all My whole life I have been extremely dysfunctional between severe ADHD goldfish brain giving me no grasp on time management or focus and my anxieties exploding my emotions all over the place and my obsessive inability to restrain precision making me suuuper slooow at everything and my autistic social ineptitude making everyone extra done with me My parents weren t the worst but they have narcissistic tendencies and drank the Boomer Kool Aid regarding child care so my difficulties were met with authoritarianism Few brief efforts were made to teach me the critical skills other kids seem to pick up on their own instead I was constantly punished for failing Middle school between my struggles getting homework done and the bullying I was at one of my lowest points ever in my life ADHD meds didn t help either I cried myself to sleep a lot when I did manage to fall asleep Things got a little better when we moved yet again and this time I found friends instead of bullies I got more lenient teachers who understood I was smart but struggling This did not last long because as time went on expectations rapidly outpaced what my raw intelligence could compensate I almost didn t graduate high school on time because of trouble completing some essays I lost my full ride college scholarship because I couldn t manage my studying at all I also was beginning to feel increasingly trapped by my overbearing parents who seemed convinced my difficulties and position as their child meant I was supposed to tell them everything and always obey them To top it off I was finally shaking off the fog of my conservative upbringing once I gained access to more internet and education Oh yeah I didn t have any real internet access until like senior year of high school During the couple short years in college and for a couple years after dropping out I tried getting various jobs to see if I could build any kind of income I worked as a lube tech at Jiffy Lube for part time got fired for struggling to clock in on the dot I worked as a lube tech at a dealership for something got stressed and anxious and dented a couple cars in the hectic environment got shunted to detail worked too slow and dented a couple more cars and got fired I worked at the local zoo in a kitchen met a machine repair guy and got a job for him for a whopping hr Eventually quit the zoo job that had me scream crying on the way home daily to commit to machine repair Few months later the small shop couldn t afford to keep me More time passes I get a job repairing upholstery also at and then stumbled into a job teaching swim lessons nearby too Eventually got fired from upholstery repair for being too slow Thought I was good on the swim job but then my idiot no filter autistic mouth said a couple things that offended a couple customers and my boss s boss fired me NONE OF THESE JOBS LASTED ME MORE THAN MONTHS OR MADE ME MORE THAN HR And I could barely handle my short hr work weeks It should also be noted that I went through a similar volume of various therapists trying to get better at adulting I got a little bit better at coping but not much else At some point I found out all those ADHD meds I had been taking my liver never actually processed the stimulants So I got on a more helpful medicine set and that helped a bit Sometime before the swim job I started going out with a guy who made me feel more motivated and adult than I ever had in my life I was yo at that point He gave me a place to live that wasn t with my smothering parents who made me feel infantile and filled the house with aggression Not being around my depressed narcissist mother especially was super good for my mental health Months go by I m mostly moved in with him After a year of this he has enough money to buy a new house and we fully move in together with trusted roomies This was really helpful for both of us as where he was living wasn t great for him either Fast forward a year later I m the most productive I have ever been in my life But it s so much less than everyone else Our roommates and my boyfriend are so frustrated by my lack of contribution With my parents all I could manage was my own laundry Now I also do the bulk of our house s grocery trips and kitchen scrubbing cooking often and I m barely making my bouncy ball brain do some studying My bf desires to see me succeed in a higher tier job and is helping me study coding and computer IT at home I m decent at doing it but terrible at focusing on it Every day I have to fight past my self hatred to get out of bed and keep fighting to stay out of bed I m worrying my antidepressant isn t working anymore like my last one suddenly did on me I m not far enough along in my studies to get a well paying job yet Disability welfare in this country is a JOKE and would prevent me from any higher aspirations My roommates say the last few times I drove them around in my currently degrading state of mind I made driving errors that make them not trust me I STILL struggle to be on time to anything so nobody trusts me on that either I can t seem to keep a normal day night sleep cycle but I also can t get ANYTHING useful done on an inverse night day sleep cycle On top of it all I can t seem to stick to any of the fun sport clubs I have been part of in the past so I can t seem to keep myself exercising which is of course one of the often suggested tips for depression It s gotten to a point where despite having improved so much at life skills here I am yo and I feel like I did in middle school again Completely hopeless hating myself on a daily basis feeling like just a burden But me hating myself stresses my bf out making him hurt which makes me feel even more worthless He s also super stressed from working a job he hates to make enough money to support us He convinced me to uninstall Netflix from my phone so I have less distractions but I had a super hard time doing it so that annoys him too The things I m already good at like making fixing stuff with my hands or helping little kids without any time management or a degree of some kind I can t get or keep any GOOD job I don t want this to keep getting worse and reach a point where I DO try something bad Right now it feels like I ll hurt people less if I somehow vanish because then eventually they d move on vs right now I actively cause problems I m gonna be talking to my amazing doc about this and finding yet another new therapist to try But I figured maybe someone here can give me some other useful advice to keep me from secretly hoping I get Covid and maybe my asthma will make me one of the unlucky ones lol,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update, Seeking Help",high

Week of grad school and I m already a failureI started grad school last week I was so excited and prepared already having chapter of each textbook read and detailed notes in my notebook While I anticipated grad school to be challenging especially when I work a full time job I did not expect this quarantine to make things x harder I thought working as a kindergarten teacher from home would allow me more free time after work to focus on my classes Instead I m being buried in emails from school directors and from parents I have to send emails every Monday with homework packets in addition to making phone calls every day to check in on parents and log their feedback onto an excel spreadsheet for the school directors to see I also have to make PowerPoints and lesson plans daily and teach live zoom classes spread out throughout each day along with attending morning teacher meetings With all this extra work and stress of parent complaints because of course they are NEVER satisfied with the work we re putting in for their kids my anxiety has been through the roof This has made it extremely difficult for me to focus on my schoolwork as I m constantly exhausted and feel too anxious about my work not being good enough so I ve struggled to make it through my discussion board posts and short papers I procrastinated because I m a fucking dumbass and get too stuck in my own head and anxiety over not being smart enough for grad school Because of this I waited til the last minute to type my paper and wound up turning it in at am It had been due at pm I had no idea that even though all the discussion posts and replies I posted were on time days before the deadline I only procrastinated the paper bc I was so stupidly scared of doing a shit job failure to turn in this paper would result in automatic withdrawal from the class My other online class is fine I have an A But now thats my only class which means its going to take me even longer to graduate and I m going to be a fucking underpaid kindergarten teacher forever I m never going to get my PsyD because I m a fucking moron who can t manage her time and swallow her stupid fucking mental issues for important shit like this Its almost am and I ve been trying to calm myself down for the past hours I finally found this place to vent to I hope that s okay My cat is with me so I m not going to hurt myself I m trying so hard to control myself but it s so hard and I m so tired,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk",high
Relationship activities So recently I have been working on self improvement and trying to to be the best version of myself I wasn t it the shape that I wanted to be in and found myself becoming not focused and lazy I have spent time on that and recently developing better workout routines and study habits Skip to yesterday I am over with a friends house and I have been texting with this girl I have had a crush on for a while I decide that it is the time and my boy who also has a gf has been hyping me up For the longest time I wanted to ask her out but assumed she would reject me I thought this could be a perfect time for me to just shoot my shot and try to improve from this situation Anyway I asked her and she freaked out and got really embarrased She said she would love to and we have been texting a ton since She said that she had a crush on me too and I was so glad it worked out I have been in relationships before but niether really count as they were just flings I m familiar with the relationship drama in our class and know that she broke up with another guy a few months ago That wasn t really a relationship either as the person who asked her never did much and didn t treat her with much respect I really know how great a person she is and I have been so happy recently I really want to have fun with her and know that I will not just leave this as a fling I have been thinking a lot about what things we should do together and since there is a pandemic right now I know it will be difficult Anyone who has been a relationship with someone especially in COVID it would be very much appreciated if you let me know some fun activities you have engaged in with your signifacant other TL DR I asked a girl who I was into if she wanted to be together and she said yeah Now I m wondering what sort of activities to do together in a COVID era,"Cause of Distress, Positive Coping, Seeking Help",medium

I think I need to check myself into a hospital I need your guys advice weeks ago I got diagnosed with a major depressive disorder It wasn t really news I ve known I ve been depressed for years approaching years now I got prescribed Zoloft and I m up to mg now I ve also been attending therapy sessions with a psychologist for about weeks now Its not working though If anything over the last few months its just been getting worse and worse and it feels like it s not even getting worse at a slower rate Over the last few years I ve made a lot of changes to try to help I went from to I started eating healthier I changed majors to something that I both enjoy more and that has more career prospects I transferred colleges since the first one wasn t working out I joined a few clubs and have actually made a few friends I even attended my first college party after years of never being invited to anything Now I ve finally gone to get professional help both psychologic and psychiatric And none of it has helped If anything its only gotten worse since I don t even have the hope that any more changes will help The hope is gone When I was a kid I used to get Pneumonia a lot I had it like times before I was I wish I d have just died back then I could have saved so much pain and my parents could have moved on now I have a ton of other people to drag down with me The latest I think I would be happy if thing has been getting in a relationship I think I m thinking this is the latest thing since its one of the only changes I haven t yet made and because I pretty genuinely hate myself I ve pretty much derived any self worth over the last few years from my GPA I don t really believe in inherent self worth I m almost now and haven t ever been on a date let alone received a non platonic hug Nobody ever expresses interest in me I always have to initiate thought I ve found this is usually the case with my friends as well if I don t initiate I d never get invited to anything I can t even watch porn anymore without feeling like shit It s not like I can avoid all these people in relationships either by isolating myself since I still have classes to go to It feels like all the changes I ve made over the years have amounted to nothing I m just so terribly lonely and miserable all the time I haven t been able to cry in years so I just self harm when I feel like crying It s not the best release and it feels like it has diminishing returns since lately it doesn t give me the rush it used to it just makes it a little easier to breath if that makes any sense Besides it beats drinking heavily like most normal people my age do though admitably I much prefer being drunk to not being drunk All my friends are out building up lives and resumes and careers It feels like I ve gotten left behind on the road of life Everyone is dating some are already married with people they love I get PMs from one of my friends from high school asking me if I ve started dating yet I keep trying to explain to him that I m trying but not having any luck Whenever dating comes up that s all I ever get I m sure you ll find someone eventually Thing is none of the I d might be happy if things before have obviously failed but this is the only change left I can make since professional and medical help has failed I don t enjoy anything anymore Dota and CSGO feel like chores EU is too frustrating now I ve already played through all the RPGs I enjoy to the point of them being mechanical to play through I don t enjoy running or hiking as much now and its too cold to do them anyways this time of year I don t have any shows I really enjoy I ve always wanted to learn to draw I m actually a huge fan of furry art but I m pretty bad and I m a perfectionist so practicing is so frustrating that I pretty much can t do it and get better Suicide has increasingly been looking like the only way things are going to get better The logic I mean with get better is that zero is still larger than a negative number so I d be better off I used to think Ok I ll wait until I turn and then I ll kill myself if things haven t improved However as things have deteriorated I ve moved that up to More recently I ve moved it up to after graduation I m thinking It could be my own graduation present to myself I don t even know how I m going to make it that far Suicide feels inevitable at this point like its something I have to do I don t buy the whole it gets better thing anymore Its been over years It really doesn t in my experience All the medical advice I ve been given when the suicidal thoughts get really bad is to distract myself I don t understand to what end though Like if I don t kill myself now then what I get to continue hurting tomorrow The only end this seems to lead to is why kill yourself now when you can just keep hurting tomorrow ad infinitum I don t see the appeal in it I think once I do it I ll go out to a nice secluded part of one of my local national parks I like and shoot myself in the head really late at night Nobody would notice I m gone possibly for a few weeks nobody would hear a thing I might not even be found My body can feed some scavengers I don t have to hurt anymore people who love me don t have to see me hurt anymore everyone wins I ve been dead inside for years its just taking the rest of me a while to catch up Of course this is still likely a few years away so I m probably not at immediate risk of killing myself So thats where I m standing It s AM right now and I can t sleep anymore because I went to bed at last night because I was out of energy and feeling suicidal again The Zoloft just gives me headaches makes me hungry and gives me constipation Nothing has helped and I don t think I can get better anymore I have another

"my mom left me on my birthday and i still feel bad about it my parents asked me what restaurant i wanted to go to for my birthday and the one i wanted to go to opened at 5 my mom said that i would need to be ready by 430pm i took a nap a couple hours before and accidentally over slept so i started getting ready at 4 instead of 330 like i wanted to sheâ€™s always been strict with time whereas my dad is laid back and doesnâ€™t care too much about punctuality 
 
 by the time it was 430 i was still doing my hair and makeup i let my mom know and she said that her and my dad were leaving and that i could uber myself there i felt really sad and embarrassed but understood 
 
 i know it was my fault and she has every right to do that a part of me still feels sad she did that on my birthday it was a really low key dinner with just the 3 of us at a restaurant down the street i felt like we wouldâ€™ve been fine if we left at 5 and still gotten seated 
 
 her strict punctuality has always brought me stress in my life and it doesnâ€™t help having severe depression and anxiety iâ€™ve always struggled with time and iâ€™m always anxious about because of her also different places and people have varying attitudes towards time for example my friends arenâ€™t punctual at all like if weâ€™re getting together at 6 we all know that technically means 6307 thatâ€™s just how we are my dadâ€™s side of the family are laid back about time too and are not punctual","Cause of Distress, Seeking Help",low

Well Here is my story I have been suffering from depression for years now All starting along time ago when at the ripe young age of my mom was diagnosed with cancer It was hard on me My father has a long hours job Always has Honestly I barely know the guy He did not really raise me I only ever say him hours a day in my entire childhood My brother and only sibling was physically and emotionally abusive through my childhood There is a hole the drywall where he decided to throw me into it once Once my mother passed away when I was I started failing miserably in school I dropped out of high school credit short of graduation Failed miserably at adult learning because of lack of motivation focus I was also bullied my entire childhood I have never had more then friends All of whom have become distant due to university college Shortly after my mothers death I had a psych breakdown from people bullying me about my dead mother I was admitted for a day of observation and they deemed me mentally stable Nothing was ever done about the bullies or my brother No matter who I went too My brother was just being bashful or playful and the occasional suspension was handed out to bullies but that really just delayed it for days before they came back Never had a girlfriend Iv managed to drown most of my sorrow in playing computer games rather then drugs I sought help once about a year and a half ago However my father brushed off my request for about months I felt better after talking to a psychiatrist However problematically it costs my father a session My GP also put me on some happy pills which helped for awhile but eventually in them self made me feel depressed in the only way I could be Happy was taking pills The financial burden of professional help is not something I am willing to place on my father So now I am not getting help Or taking drugs Back to square one of being miserable This has also adversly effected my lifestyle I eat between and meals a day Sleep no more then hours Finally I have begun to consider suicide as a way out I dont know Thats my jumbled mess of life experience thoughts and reasonings,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update",high

I know it doesn t mean much but here At this point I have no where else to turn too My friends don t want to hear it my family doesn t and so on With what little I have I honestly just need to vent before I die I m the standard age where no one knows what to do or where to go I want to be a writer I m just the fucking definition of a loser I learned a long time ago when I was I was diagnosed with not only depression by a very light form of autism Basicly I don t understand something s when it comes to learning it wasn t anything that couldn t be treated with therapy However the depression stuck I was bullied mercilessly at school and not one of the teachers or principles gave a damn about it They where more content to just watch It was embarressing to them that they had to go up to the government and tell them to fucking fix it Through out that part of my life I was a loner and never thought I would get friends I would just come home from school go play video games and imagine I was a hero a hero that no one understood but still wanted him around Then high school came My first year in grade proved to be the best part of my life I joined Anime Club I became a dnd player I made tons of new friends I helped set up a convention and so on But then grades and happened I met this one girl and at first I was shocked she asked me out first I took her to a movie and we kissed once I think then she didn t want to date me anymore and it was only a three week relationship so I didn t think much of it then her friend came into my English class and yelled stop raping my friend That s where it all went down hill The only place I was from that point was the anime club I was called a freak and a rapist At the same time a guy wanted to kill me constantly tried to set me on fire twice in the same day People relentlessly mocked me and I was the out cast again same deal in g At that point I reached fucked it and for my grad quote I said thank you Flying Spaghetti Monster The only people that liked that where the anime club members and my history teacher Everyone else got mad at me and said that was offensive and it didn t get better from their I left the high school and never turned back after I was done with tests and such Then the college College was to be a fresh start a new beginning but life has a way of fucking you up their as well As I said before I wanted to be a writer I wanted to write sci fi I took psychology English history and political environment But English and political weren t what I thought they where At first English was nice I met a girl their and we started dating for six months and the proffesor was really nice However things took a turn in the classes when it all became about how sucky men are and how awesome women are Both English and political environment kept saying that over and over and over again Men ruined this men ruined that white men destroyed everything that was good Hearing that day in and day out got on my nerves I know I wasn t bad I tried to be the better person in life but it never stuck I felt alone in those classes as no one wanted to hear um what about The writer of game of thrones He s white and awesome And so on but no all the stories we read white men are bad All the political talk was Tumblr and SJW bull shit disproven by multiple doctors and institutions And the tipping point was my gf at the time At first she was the women of my dreams She was beautiful to me shy nerdy a little creepy really liked creepy weird stuff and so on but then she met another girl and this girl twisted her as she was her only friend out side of me She would poke and prod my gf telling her I was bad and intentionally go out of her way to strain our relationship It got to the point my gf was starting to mentally abuse me andverbally abuse me I tried to fight for her I tried and nearly became I love her and I don t care what she does to me But my friends stopped me and forced me to look into the reality of the picture she was bad for me I gave it into our relationship but she gave nothing back I confronted her about it and everything I accused her of she accepted and never even once defended her self She accepted everything I said and had no remorse over it I then told her to go fuck her self and left breaking up with her And then even to add on to that her friend abanonded her after as she got what she wanted After that I then started focusing on finding a job but that came to no avail their was one girl I tried dating online but she just cheated on me and abandoned me I tried therapy only for it to fail me miserably six years of it and nothing came from it My family is sick and tired of seeing me sad I don t even talk to them about it anymore I just go and out a fake smile on to try and let them know I m fine when secretly I m not My friends abandoned me they go to me for their problems and when I try to go to them it s stunning radio silience I m alone and I have nobody the only

How I gained weight from being Anorexic So I just made a body positivity post yesterday on my body years ago vs my body now days ago I received a lot of love and support so thank you But a lot of people asked me questions and here is my answer What is anorexia In the DSM the book of mental illnesses and disorders yes I have read it yes I read it sometimes anorexia is defined as A Refusal to maintain bodyweight at or above minimally normal weight for height age less than th percentile B Intense fear of gaining weight or becoming obese even though underweight C Disturbed by one s body weight or shape self worth influenced by body weight or shape or persistent lack of recognition of seriousness of low bodyweight D In menstruating females absence of at least consecutive non synthetically induced menstrual cycles I can safely say I fit all that and went through all that all my years being anorexic and recovering although I am technically still in recovery How did I gain weight I started taking vitamins such as vitamin D C omega fish oil pills they are huge and hard to swallow centrum which is a women s multivitamin so men you guys should take the male one I also take iron supplements because it turns out I was also anemic low iron Eat whatever you want whenever you want A lot is convincing yourself it s okay to eat this and it s okay to splurge I remember I felt very guilty fat ugly gross I had tried throwing it all up even but that will just make you feel worse I used to eat and eat and eat until my stomach felt beyond full and I felt like throwing up but then pushed through and slept it off Eating more will make more space in your stomach so the feeling of being too full will be farther away and achieved by eating even more It s like tricking yourself into eating more eat greasy food the grease is fat and fat content is what you need to gain weight I ate a shit ton of junk food I also ate a shit ton of rice and beans and tofu and paneer and cheese Milk products white bread pastas candy chocolates on my period I would convince myself the chocolate was needed Don t work out I guess part of it was my depression but I didn t work out at all I used to do yoga but then I got injured and was unable and I noticed how much weight yoga actually burned and kept from me gaining weight So I have not been working out I ve just been letting the weight build up Make excuses to eat Breakfast is very important I found that I have a newfound love for everything bagels with a shit ton of butter and salt with iced coffee so everyday I eat that for breakfast Go out to eat I know not everyone can afford this but I mean like McDonald s or something if you buy the food yourself and see how much it actually cost you can convince yourself you have to eat it because you spent so much money on it Family and friends used to bully me and skinny shame me So many skinny jokes so many anorexic jokes and I was so fucking tired of it all so I was like you know what I ll show you They still make those jokes but not as much anymore Some say I ve gotten to a better weight and I m doing good My mom calls me fat when she gets mad and although I get mad at least she s not calling me bones anymore Anyway I hoped this helped or helps you guys snd doesn t get lost in new Again I m very thankful for the support and also thanks to the mod who removed creepy shit from my post I posted it at night and woke up in the morning to nothing but positivity,"Cause of Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Mental Distress, Positive Coping",medium

"I am 25F. I was diagnosed with depression at 12, and borderline personality disorder at 23. It comes and goes, but when its bad its BAD. Things are not going amazing in my life at the moment, but also not particularly bad, either. But i feel like I am in a serious slump.I have tried therapy multiple times in the last 13 years, multiple different therapists and approaches but it honestly has never done anything for me at all.I have been on SO many different medications throughout the years, and finally am on one that helps more than the others, but still not fully. Nobody in my family deals with any mood disorders, so they are not very understanding when i do go through slumps, so i feel like I am not taken seriously and no one truly understands how bad i feel.I also do not want to try therapy again for the simple fact that i cannot afford it. I make too much for Medicaid, and even with good insurance i was paying almost $300 out of pocket, twice a month, just for therapy alone, not including my general appointments for my medication.I really only have 3 people i can talk to. One being my boyfriend of 6 years, who is supportive and as helpful as he can be, but given the fact hes never struggled with it himself, he does not really understand. The other is my best friend who is honestly not the greatest friend in general, and i feel like i bother her when i talk to her. The last person is my sister, but she picks and chooses when she wants to listen/help.I hate burdening people with my issues, and i feel that is all i do.

"A couple of years ago, prior to being diagnosed-- I impulsively cheated on my husband. I still take accountability in my wrong doings even though I know it was a very manic, triggered impulse state in my borderline recovery. Since then, I've worked to change my life around completely. I work now, have created a life and goals for myself, and pay for therapy sessions out of pocket (bc my insurance doesn't work with this therapist and she's been integral in my recovery) and really DO the work daily to not let borderline rule me or my impulses anymore. I still feel them-- especially as I was taught from early ages to equate self worth with sexuality etc, but I work hard daily to be better. 
 
 I confessed everything to my husband a year and a half ago, and my marriage has really changed for the better. Before where we had no connection, we have finally been best friends now the last while. Each other's cheerleaders. Until today it was revealed to me he has been cheating on me with someone and has a whole relationship with them. He's had to live away for a few months, while I stay with our son and it just feels like such a slap in the face. I've done all of this work for myself yes, but my marriage too. ): I just feel so hurt. He did confess it all today and said it was ""just an eye for an eye.""

A good life isn t meant for everyone some people have to suffer can we live with it Is it worth it Laurel Is what worth it Life is it worth it I don t know what kind of question is that I guess sometimes it can be and sometimes it is not but the times its worth living make it ultimately worth living I don t understand why it hurts sometimes One moment I m okay and then the next I am contemplating being alive It sucks I doesn t make sense that this is the life I got It s crazy how some people have it better than others and don t have to go through the feelings of loneliness not being able to connect with people having family that is only their cause they are your family Knowing that if you weren t related to them they wouldn t care a damn about you Having people not see you as someone that is worth it Being used and thrown away when it s convenient I m not living a life that everyone else is living I ve learned that people will use you to satisfy themselves whether it be family friends or significant others I don t even get to live to the lie of believing that some people will genuinely care about me I know how women are I know how friends are I know how family is Maybe I ve been given shit examples or maybe I ve been given the best ones Cause now I know I know that for some reason I am different whether that be for better or worse I don t know yet as of know it has been for the utter worse I m only At least that is what I say to make myself feel better People say that their teenage years were the best years you get to live carefree do dumb things you get to live Yet I haven t done any of those things I have always felt alone always been the outcast I haven t got to experience life I have just been waking up day by day hoping tomorrow will be different but its not I still wake up hoping that maybe today will be different maybe my life will change today I have been thinking that since I was in middle school and nothing has changed As I ve aged it has only gotten worse My new experiences have turned out to be tragic lessons I went through a severe depression period the third nine weeks my junior year for reasons I still don t understand Is there something wrong with me There must be right Why can I not be oblivious to things why do I always have to face the reality of the situation I can never trick myself into feeling better about a certain situation I always realize exactly what it is that got me there exactly the reasons for why it happened For example I met someone I felt like I connected with her we had a freakishly lot of stuff in common I felt like okay finally I get to have my person to get close to romantically then boom its was over in less than months It went to shit A damn pandemic hit I just lost her Instead of me being able to oh well its life I fully understand why it even happened in the first place I was used I was the rebound she had her friend group trashed by her ex she wasn t even over him she just wanted to forget she just wanted to hope things would go back to what they were with him She never wanted to like me she felt she had to like me Basically went cold turkey on me Am I not worth talking too You don t even care to know if I m alive I never could understand this and I still don t understand this So I ask a question do you even like me Seen but no reply What do I do I m hurting again Except I know what is best for me I know to leave Its what I m best at Severing the link I say I can t do this I really do want someone to at least like me in a relationship What do I get Text Although we are similar The more I got to know you the more I knew we wouldn t last and that s nothing against you Why do I even bother It s not worth it I felt terrible Not because I broke up with her I felt terrible cause is that is how she really felt Could a girl say we are alike but still not even like me How does that make since How is that even possible So many questions and I just wanted answers Yet I was so insignificant I couldn t even garner a response None to my text None to my phone calls Nothing Not even a drop in the water Why even bother Dodged a bullet anyway but maybe it should have hit me I do what I do best I delete her number and hit the forbidden key unfollow That was months ago What s the point anyway What is done is done I was what I was and I am what I am No sense in changing it only finding better ways to cope with what I am Who I am Maybe it was never meant for me to be regular to be like everyone else To experience what everyone else is experiencing Friends Family lovers experiences Maybe it was never meant for me I want to continue writing maybe I should I could write about how my good friend hooked up with another friend girl of mine and hasn t talked to me since I initiate contact every time but its been over a month and he hasn t even wanted to know if I m alive What the point So many questions At why do I have to go through this now Why do I work my ass off to get nothing in return I m in the best shape of my life I have a source of income couple thousand saved I still feel in the same place I feel worse cause I achieved but why am I

I don t even know anymore I usually don t ever post how I m feeling on threads or even tell my therapists how I m truly truly feeling because I feel guilty for these thoughts that cross my mind But I feel like I m going to go crazy after this Christmas I hate this time of year I ve always had mental health issues been hospitalized twice as a teenager self harmed drank mouthwash just to get drunk to ignore my feelings whatever I had a great life growing up nothing really triggered me to become this way I guess my brain is very chemically imbalanced Anyway I m I had my daughter at to keep the story short I had a healthy pregnancy besides my type one diabetes but I took care of myself I was scheduled to be induced and she was perfectly healthy at the time however due to doctors negligence and not paying attention to signs of distress She was born having seizures in minutes and her whole brain was completely damaged I was told she would not live the ideal life If you saw her in person today you would never guess anything was wrong with her but there is she is doing way more than anyone expected however I ve noticed my mental health getting worse and worse every year she was diagnosed with HIE LGS and type diabetes within the first years of her life now that she s getting older her seizures are getting worse she s becoming more delayed and I just honestly hate saying I don t want to do it anymore I m tired of seeing kids happy on Christmas while my daughter is out of it not knowing how to rip open a present I hate her birthday because her grandparents want to throw her a party every year and I hate everyone watching her open gifts me opening them and she s just so out of it and has no clue what s going on and I don t mean I don t want to do it anymore as in I don t want her anymore because I love my child to death she s the strongest child I know that can light up a room with her smile I mean I don t want to watch her struggle every day of her life even though she doesn t realize it I have become so numb to her daily seizures because it s the normal for our family Im tired of the mix between of hopeful days and I don t even know what s coming days I don t want to die but I just don t want to live anymore It makes me so upset seeing neurotypical kids doing normal things and I have to watch my daughter just struggle to walk sometimes I hate feeling this way I fucking hate it Having LGS also means at any given time if she falls asleep she might not wake up due to a seizure in her sleep I hate this overwhelming feeling I feel selfish most days since she s the one who s really struggling I m at a very all time low in my life I don t even know what I want anymore I just feel so numb to these doctors appointments I have to go to for her I question am I doing enough or not how can I do enough when I m depressed and numb as ever just sitting on the couch watching her do the same things over and over and over I don t even know how to express this to anyone because it s the same response oh I m so sorry I know it s hard but your strong blah blah blah I get people don t know what to say but at the end of the day it s something I have to do Something I still have to deal with Words won t change anything because that doctor did permanent damage I would never end my life but I just don t want to live anymore and I can t get these constant worrying feelings out of my head I try to look at the reality point of view but I still feel like I m going to just have a huge mental breakdown and idk where I m going with this I just needed this off my chest God I love my daughter so much she did not deserve this suffering I just want my will to live back,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update, Seeking Help",high

At what point is it better to die than to live this way I ve been struggling with this condition for months now with no sign of recovery of my waking life my mind is blank completely devoid of mental activity It is a constant struggle of mine to maintain any form of awareness Additionally my short term and long term memory function at nearly amnesiac levels and my ability to focus and simply put think are at an atrociously low level My brain has a complete absence of mental activity This subjective experience is hard for me to quantify or explain but almost all the time my mind is completely blank like a zombie In a sense I m mentally catatonic like someone gave a computer the wattage of a light bulb just enough energy to give the appearance of awareness Every moment I m awake is a struggle to maintain some form of consciousness When not stimulated by loud music video games or the constant novelty of the Internet I zone out My mind is completely empty there is no thought whatsoever This brings me to my memory issues both short and long term trying to remember what I did as recently as yesterday requires a huge amount of effort Sometimes I ll be able to remember scattered details about the day before like where I had lunch but memories are scattered and non linear Trying to remember something that happened a day ago a week ago or a year ago feels the same There is just no clarity of memory I feel perpetually spaced out my mind feels foggy as though I m in a dream or under the influence of some substance I feel awake yet not awake sleepy although im physically fully awake I have trouble with social interaction because I just don t know what to say most of the time Frequently i have to stop and think of a decent response just to look normal because otherwise there d be nothing I have to say The times I do have something to speak up on I often stutter because I have trouble finding the right words to use or put them together in a sentence There are times where I ll just mentally blank out mid utterance and have not a clue what I wanted to say next I feel like I m just existing in this one moment with no past no connection to the present and no future I d rather die than live the rest of my life as this empty shell of a person,"Mental Distress, Positive Coping",medium

survived attempt last year feel Death laughing in my face ever sinceprobably attempt or was last year lost count when i moved to the city haven t died died soo idk if its even considered attempting just hard failing hahaha havent slept so this will probably be ranting Got a sous job felt great started to feel alienated hosts werent listening chefs weren t listening i just felt over whelmed like what the fuck am i even doing in a kitchen whatever it s not like they even called my ICE contacts to check on me so pfft lets die ok boom lets go I think at the time I woke up again and just started dying I just felt weak like I would probably bust my head on the way to the bathroom I remember wanting to die but just panicking bc i knew that this would just end really badly I took somewhere between and hundred pills of zquil tylenol advil pms And all I could think of in the moment was fuck No anti nausea meds dumbass so I start blowing chunks obvs lost my pill count I knew if anything I just fucked up my system and it s going to be long ass week I remember smiling at whoever intubated me bc I knew it was all fucked stuck in icu for a few days but i enjoyed it my dreams were the scariest but turned into the most beautiful things after i m guessing a few days I really hoped in my heart of hearts that I was at least in purgatory I wake up to find a friend at my feet I didn t want that I wanted everyone gone I didn t tell anyone bc I really just wanted to die y ya How did this turn into a whole thing I didn t want her there or SOs mom looking at me as i lay passed out I just felt more alone with everyone Even Sos friend knew i wouldnt have minded but they stayed over like the next month and i could just feel quiet judgement or at least weird quiet no one talked about it but his friend and his SO knew his friends SO said she was glad I was ok before they left after the weekend Fucking slutbag idk u or your bf but you both are balls deep in my business ok anyway I remember waking up again on one to one but I had my phone I looked up my balance to check my deposits and either my balance was or was missing I think it was supposed to be around something or almost I bring it up to SO who got defensive saying so much was going on and he was worried MTG games Beer Cigarettes thats where the cash went He said cleaning but there was still friggin nyquil goo on the floor and the trash wasn t taken out when I got back from the loony bin call me heartless but idk i was out for a few days and hundo was gone lol how would it have been if i just died like So i was supposed to see a friend after it all almost died near Katz deli light said walk and I was inches away from getting it by a produce bus that ran the light and I felt so alive now I just wished i took a fucking step real quick I wanted to think there was a reason I was here that it was the universe saying I was leaving on her terms or not at all Go to this place to wait waited almost an hour for my friend to come by while the waiter ignored me which I guessed made me feel smaller than most times Ah well still alive but since then it feels all downhill Lost touch with that galpal but we were both sad I felt like sometimes she did things to make me feel smaller but also feel like its just the fear of inadequacy telling me that I do feel like she took me to a dark place that was unnecessary though I felt wasn t allowed to really have problems there was someone else who had something terrible happen couldnt visit or call the loony bin bc she was busy then why be over me in icu with ur sister who doesnt even know me But at a certain point I felt like she always wanted to be the little wounded deer everyone helped but refused help bc she was too tuff She talked about how certain people resented her and how shitty everyone was but I feel like she was a mean girl on the low Like she has called me crying she has been to my house at godless hours bc she was alone i have literally dressed her wounds we were thicc thieves together for a minute then I guess I got too much Always late to see me not texting for days not really asking about me and I felt like the one always seeking approval and I felt she liked that bc she also felt shit Or maybe she was too depressed for friendship and maybe i m just a needy piece of shit Alone now so who is really laughing SO has been supporting me on and off bc I can t hold a job anymore I think a few months before my big job he kept saying how I can t hold a job idk it was in an argument and now I really can t Both drank and argued a lot think it calmed officially a couple of months ago once I officially lost income for my own hard stuff Right now he is playing fortnite Before he took a nap at he was also playing it And yesterday Yes Also playing We went to the store yesterday and just holding the basket not talking about anything not discussing anything he just took time off work to get a different job and I feel like I am good bc I am convenient I gave up my lease to be with him and now I feel like it s an obligation to take care of the things he can t won t because he supports me and is happy with me sometimes I feel like he s just been accustomed to having a plus one it s not like a partner I have no one and no where to go no money and no income as unhealthy as we are together sometimes he is all I have here aside from immediate family he talks to sometimes I feel like I am also his only friend sometimes i don t want to die I just want to go far away so he can develop on his own He doesn t get depression and I remember even throwing a noose I made at him he was shocked and we stopped arguing that night but guess where that noose is still on my dresser and we live in a studio wild I ve had terminations and one miscarriage st was bc of my new job which was a simple choice save up and start then the second I had been home from hospital for a little over a month the last one I got a pill to finish bc I was but it was gone already He doesn t want to be a father he said yes the last time but it was so scared and hollow i just had to go with my gut and went to the doc for the news and I don t think we should raise a child who will grow up around resentment im a foster kid so tbh i would rather be a single mom but that was a whole thing so I can t see myself having his child and

Tonight for the first time ever I m genuinely wondering if I want to keep goingI m I ve always been a pretty big time loner and since my middle school years have been very prone to bits of depression and despondence But tonight is the first time I ve ever genuinely wondered whether or not I wanted to keep going I ve been trying to sleep for three hours but there s just no way The thoughts are too strong I look at my own life I have a college degree that I can t use in a field I don t enjoy I m stuck bagging groceries and don t actually aspire to do anything more I have no one I d consider a friend My relationship with my family grows more and more distant as I begin to hate myself and withdraw myself more and more I don t see anything to look forward to I look at the world around me What a complete and total fucking mess Pandemic panic climate crises ever worsening political polarization rise in totalitarianism and Draconian policy worldwide I just don t see a single god damn thing to look forward to More and more I ve been projecting my self hatred onto others I view them as being like me Lowlife failures whose lives aren t worth anything I m not deserving of love assistance attention affection or acknowledgement and therefore neither are they And I hate myself a lot Hating everyone else that much is exhausting I could talk to a professional but that s a tough one for me When I was I was struggling in class because I hated myself back then to and wasn t trying so my mom dragged me to a psychiatrist On the spot he diagnosed me with ADD and gave me an Adderall prescription The third time I took it I was rushed to the hospital with a seizure that was caused by the medication This psych s solution was to see if my doctor could prescribe me a downer to go with the Adderall so that didn t happen again So since then my trust in the entire healthcare profession is utterly non existent I actively believe they try to harm their patients for profit Opening up to a therapist won t be easy or productive I don t think I d view it as walking into a room with a live grizzly bear I m just waiting for the harm to come my way So I hate myself a lot don t feel like there s anything going on in the future that s worth looking forward to and I feel just utterly broken I desperately need a break from social media that includes Reddit but unfortunately I hate myself too much to do what s right for me I m not sure I deserve help or that a person like me is worth talking down Maybe this ll pass Who knows But I ve never felt this before I should be in the prime of my life in my mid s But instead all I can bring myself to do is sit in my room alone on my laptop That s it That s what I aspire to I hate myself so much,"Cause of Distress, Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Progress Update",medium

My mom s birthday almost became the date of my best friend s suicideI ll preface this by saying she s safe right now But last night she was on the verge of suicide for the nd time in the past few months She was under the influence extremely emotional her parents were angry with her and she had just broken up with her boyfriend at a party I was with her at She texted me that they broke up and I knew I had to find her because she would hurt herself if she was alone but I didn t know where she was She was sending me her phone password and saying I could have her money and she told me to tell him she loved him all while I was texting and calling her and begging her to not do anything because I was on the way to her house I called my mom sobbing into the phone while I heard her birthday party in the background and told her what was happening and she agreed to meet me at her house I told her dad that she was saying she was going to commit suicide and he said he would talk to her but from past experience I knew he didn t know how to help her or keep her safe I came inside to talk to her both of us crying and in some bizarre turn we started making each other laugh and I knew she was ok for at least the night The thing is both my parents and her parents didn t take me very seriously and I could tell they thought I was overreacting the way only a teenage girl can I do get very paranoid and have problems with emotional stability but I really believe she almost died last night She ended up apologizing with her boyfriend and they got back together But I know she s suicidal with professionally diagnosed untreated depression and anxiety and capable of killing herself if they break up for good I m going to talk to my therapist and try to convince her to get help again but I m not sure what else I can do,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update",high

"I'm tired of losing chunks of time out of my day. Ending up somewhere and not even remembering leaving where I was before. Now I have to tell my boss tomorrow that I just didn't have any guests and it was dead so I left instead of, ""I don't know man at first I was at work and then I was standing on the doorstep of my apartment"" because, lmao, I want to keep my fucking job.

Apologies about being a terrible parent don't mean shit when I deal with this every fucking day of my life.

I ve set a date to dieI guess a little background first might be useful I m I ve suffered from depression pretty much constantly since I was and I probably was depressed long before actually being diagnosed In the last few years I ve started different courses at university all of which I ve ended up having to drop out of because I couldn t handle the workload and my depression would get really bad this leaves me feeling really worthless particularly when I see all my peers beginning to start careers I ve never had a girlfriend probably largely due to my lack of confidence not that I would end my life over something so petty but it contributes to my feeling of worthlessness The girl I ve liked for the past few years already has a boyfriend which would be easier to deal with if he wasn t a complete jerk and practically the opposite of me eg overflowing with confidence doesn t really give a shit about anyone but himself A few months ago I decided to tell her how I felt despite this not intending to interfere with her relationship mainly just thinking it might help me move on which it didn t unfortunately I did this through facebook as I couldn t get a chance to speak to her alone and even though she didn t seem to think less of me for it I ve regretted doing that ever since On top of that I really don t have any friends and never really have only people who are friends in certain situations never really inviting me anywhere or socializing outside of those situations whereas I have tried to do that so I m constantly feeling alone and feeling like I don t belong anywhere So I ve planned a date to kill myself Like most people I don t actually want to die but I can t keep going like I have been and I ve run out of options in fact part of the reason I decided to set a date was to hopefully change my mind and make myself less likely to do something impulsively and I even decided on several things that if they happened I wouldn t kill myself but I realize now those things aren t likely to happen between now and then I was trying to decide between dates one of which was today but ended up deciding on the later date because it gives me the chance to do things I want to do first I don t really know what I expect to get out of this I ve already tried so much and seen several counsellors psychologists and psychiatrists and I ve improved a bit but I don t know how to keep going any more anyway I figure it can t hurt to post here,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update, Seeking Help",high

Just want to share these past couple days with you allEarly hours Thursday morning my nana attempted suicide She ODed on a mixture of prescription drugs and paracetamol My aunt checked on her a few hours later found her collapsed beside her bed she had been sick and was unconscious Eye bleeding from where she knocked her head on her beside table She had rosary beads and my grandads pocket watch in her hand Two ambulances arrived and took her away There was a carrier bag of empty medicine packets A bit of background My Nan has attempted this before she myself and many other members of my family have suffered varying levels of depression at different times for different reasons My Nan turns this year She was witty active creative and thoughtful She was diagnosed with terminal fibrosis of the lungs months ago and her quality of life declined rapidly more than we had realised The paramedics on a rd attempt managed to revive her and she was put into Critical Intensive Care Since then I ve witnessed the raw shock and emotion from my family members When only weeks ago I had considered suicide again I related to her so much but from a totally different perspective Her chances of survival were next to none primarily because her lungs were too weak but there was also brain damage from the minutes she was unresponsive in the ambulance I don t know why I m writing this out I don t exactly have a point but it s pushed me away from suicide for now I understand Nan truly I do She is still in hospital her lungs expected to give out some time tonight For the brief time she was conscious and able to get some words out to us she apologised As incredible the technology and the teams are that brought my Nan back for a brief amount of time I really believe that if somebody is mentally capable of choosing to end their life especially when faced with a terminal illness we should let them go I would ve done the same There s much more I can talk about more of my nans last words all the differing views of my family some want to cover up the fact there was a suicide attempt but that just adds to the stigma This discussion is necessary Whatever I m tired Self harming still but suicide has been pushed back for another time,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update",high

somebody its not that i am killing myself right now but the direction i am heading is not good it will be a matter of time so any suggestion would be appreciated tldr These are my weird and bizarre thoughts and stories so far I know these are very poor mentality thoughts but it is true what i feel Now i realised that back when i was in school i have somewhat OCD I used to align carpets symmetrically and books in order idk why but i used to do it Grade diagnosed with sinusitis and eye problem and later migraine went to several hospitals everything became okay within months From childhood I was a lonely type small family and less talkative introvert but I used to play and it s very good Grade okay I used to align the bedsheet properly and wash leg frequently sometimes but it went in week In Grade I chose mathematics instead of biology idk why seeing others and thinking I cannot do and takes a huge amount of time and money idk if i had interest in anything at all had slight interest in becoming a doctor slight cause i have seen them working closely and it seems so reputed profession and all Sometimes I have irritability problems can t resist loud voices and sometimes even bad weather can affect my mood my mood depends on external factors My performance depends on external factors Now grade a deep voice constantly argues that u should have gone there that is your goal u came here seeing others and all and somewhere i feel i cheated myself Grades are good Everything is good Now I have started making few friends Cannot even connect to people Hoping Nobody likes me and all Some days I felt so alone too I did the entrance examination and I did well But now in college i feel more alone more lost that i don t even know where I am i am not feeling good Before even starting my career I am feeling I cannot I cheated myself I am not good I know nothing then idk why i became anxious I feel people are judging me i feel people dont like me i am not smart and this is a complete new field which might be to some extent true And i am running from myself Can t make genuine friends Confidence none self respect shattered Idk i feel i dont have good friends And i am becoming toxic Grade is not bad so far but i am not even close to what i could have done I am totally not happy i feel so lost so alone there are people around me but I feel lost And No everything is not okay I never sent a resume Because i don t think I am even worthy Even when some people ask me with care I feel i dont deserve anything good I should not be happy people don t like me My close friends dont like me This is a different field and i know nothing Day by day my self hatred grows I feel i am cheating on myself and i am fake I hardly go to relatives Because I feel i am not good enough smart enough I am not worthy I have let down its like i am hiding something and i don t want to go there its like i am not good and they wont like me And I feel so alone so lost let down and everything the more i try the more i go down i feel i dont have friends I cannot do anything amp i am done The college experience is so bad that i dont even want to appear i want an escape Now i dont want to code read write and all i just want to sleep all day and sometimes i wish i werenot even born I never applied to companies cause i dont even know what i am doing I cannot imagine my future it feels like i am just moving or doing this in just the shake of doing there is no extra hours and deep interest And at times i feel so irritated so angry that i don t like the place i don t like to code now feels like i am totally done then sometimes I think about fate palmistry existential crisis and all I feel so lost and isolated and sometimes i don t even know who i am i feel judged and people would find out No everything is not okay I am not feeling good not even a day i don t have proper skill i cannot connect with friends and i am done with fake smile i am done with faking i am not having good experience at all and when i see my parents and other ppl thinking he is smart and all Sometimes i burst into tears Not a thing is okay its not okay i have told for quite a few years that it will be okay but it is still the same i feel unconfident about me I am constantly let down I cannot do things I want to isolate myself Now sometimes I think I cannot learn anything I wont get a job I don t think how long i can bear like this sometimes I feel I am in huge trouble sometimes everything seems fine But I constantly swing back and forth between these emotions these days Now when I see myself i feel so sorry for myself Sorry for my parents If only I had no parents I would have quitted already It is okay from outside but it is not okay at all I feel so fucked up trapped and i don t think i can change anything how can I i don t have proper motivation I don t even know what i am doing who i am going to be where I am I hate myself and i don t think i can change anything constant thoughts that u are not good u cannot do anything The thing you are doing is quite not meaningful You dont like it You are so boring You just dont know it and all And the biggest problem is now i dont want to do it i have no motivation i dont want to do anything That feeling when you feel so lost Your charm is already lost Deep down you know you have been a failure and at this point sometimes it feels like it is easy to quit cause how could you even fight u are so fragile u cannot even tell anyone How could I tell that i am not feeling good about myself If only I had some interest motivation to do work less anxious and less edgy thoughts and a little bit of luck A hopeful and non disturbing thoughts things would change slowly Nothing is going good No nothing is good i don t have friends I am isolated I am at my worst i feel so negative about myself that i feel i have no one that understands me Idk why my mind constantly tell i would have become great in another field I am not satisfied with myself I am not happy i don t think i am complete within myself there are people around me but i feel so lost alone And i think its because of my lack of motivation towards career its not that i don t like this career but i idk why i feel so anxious and idk if because of my thoughts i am feeling low or because of my career i am feeling low i just don t know Last months have been the worst I felt so anxious restless Sometimes I could even imagine myself dead constant headaches vomiting living recklessly not caring about anything i just don t see any hope at times i thought death would be kindness somedays i dont think i can even make it somedays i feel so excited Restless So Hopeful i have even slept all day cried times a day stared at fan for hours everything seems so lost and mostly i just don t know what i am talking about Sometimes it feels it is there Sometimes it feels it is not there I get upset and excited very easily too Even slight things can upset me emotionally I hate myself so much and idk how i can change at all I feel so angry frustrated I cannot get angry at others i have zero interest to fight back too I have nothing in my checklist i am truly dead already that is true i just dont want to read code and learn anything zero motivation to do anything i feel i am not ready not enough and it is true i am not

Why is the milk gone Why did you forgot to buy milk Well that s the interesting question See you were going to get some on the way home yesterday but then you remember that you need some bread as well so u went to bread house however the alcohol store was on the way to the bread house So you went there first just because you been doing quite a lot of drinking alone and if by recently you mean last year and the have this new alcohol apple flavor vodka Which was pretty cool and you brought and then forgot to buy milk so really the milk is gone because of vodka but really you only went to buy vodka cuz it s been a cloudy day and you wanted to cheer yourself up a bit and it s only been a cloudy day because of the temperature differential brought on by east moving winds and pressure fluctuations So really the milk is gone because of the weather but the weather is only there because of the atmosphere which formed about billion years ago result of gas escaping from earths interior so the milk is gone because of the earth But the earth is only there because a gas cloud condensed into the sun and the solar system a few billion years ago and all of that came from the Big Bang billion of years before that so really the milk is gone because space and time materialized out of nothing billion years ago So if that the case Did the universe always knew that billion years when it exploded formed into galaxies and stars and they gave rise to planets and planets developed ecosystem single cell life complex organisms humans human society domestication of cows the invention of coffee milk in coffee fridges and finally you that you would eventually run out of milk billion years later Well maybe If You re playing snooker or pool or whatever and you hit a ball at a certain angle and speed and if you have a good enough computer you can say where the ball are going to go right It s all predetermined If you take the same shot times the outcome will be the same times well if the Big Bang happens time over just the way it it did billion years ago would you run out of milk a times billion later And doesn t that mean that you re life is already determined Like day of your birth and death was already predicted the moment came into being and everything has to happen in a certain way just that way just like a pool game No definitely not We ve got free will right I mean just because the universe is made of of atoms bumping into each other that have to act in a certain way based on what happened before and just because your brain is made up of atoms that doesn t mean they have to do the same thing and all are the part of the same system you can still just decided to do stuff right BECAUSE IF NOT THEN WE ARE JUST BALLS IN A COSMIC GAME OF POOL WITH NO FREE WILL AT ALL MEANING WE RE JUST ROBOTS CAUGHT IN A DETERMINISTIC SYSTEM WITH JUST ILLUSION OF CHOICE BUT REALLY HAVING NO CONTROL WHATSOEVER OVER OUR LIFE DELUDING OUR SELF INTO THINKING WE RE SOMEHOW DIFFERENT TO ALL THE OTHER ATOMS IN THE UNIVERSE AND THAT WOULD MEAN YOU VE NEVER MADE A REAL CHOICE AND YOU NEVER WILL AND WHATEVER YOU DECIDE TO DO NEXT IN LIFE ISN T A DECISION AT ALL BUT WAS ALWAYS GOING TO HAPPEN AND THERE S NO POINT TO EVER DOING ANYTHING EVER AGAIN BECAUSE EVERYTHING WAS PREDECIDED AT THE BEGINNING OF TIME AND LIFE AND LIFE IS COMPLETELY MEANINGLESS AND EMPTY AND FUCK IT FUCK MILK black coffee is fine,"Cause of Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Mental Distress",medium

"Without going into detail, this diagnosis explains so much. The sudden break ups, severe mood swings, destructive and controlling behaviour - all makes a lot more sense now.
 We have been on and off for the past 7 months since we broke up, but recently we’ve been on and it’s genuinely felt like we’re rebuilding a meaningful connection again.
 She came to me straight away after her psychology appointment to talk to me about it, and what it could mean for us in the future. She shared her insecurities and concerns about it, but also what she knows she can build on within her self moving forward. She told me with confidence that she is willing to give our relationship a good shot again, and I am too.
 Being aware of her diagnosis, we can work together and with help of her psychologist it looks like she’s getting back on track again - and I’m willing to support her through all of this.
 She’s asked me not to tell anyone about this at least until she’s ready, so that’s why I’ve come here to update this subreddit.

never been this at risk I m scared I struggled a lot throughout my life but I don t think I ve ever felt this scared for myself I genuinely am at risk for taking my own life I am in a house that has an abundance of medication and we have guns and ammunition I don t know how much longer I can withstand these feelings I m and behind a year in school I dropped out for a period of time because my mental health was so bad I thought my old friends were plotting against me so that I would die That followed a rough break up I still care a lot for my ex and he is my fp I have BPD traits but most are under control I was doing somewhat okay even with the stress of wanting to build a friendship with my ex and that heartbreak but things suddenly came to a huge halt My emotional support animal who I did everything with suddenly passed after an emergency surgery attempt we didn t even know what was going on He had a fatal mutation of a virus and couldn t be saved This happened October Since then things have gotten worse I talked to my ex that night and he was supportive but I didn t talk to him again since as I knew he had exams and didn t want to get in the way I can barely function without my cat and I ve become severely depressed I ve been binge eating constantly and that just makes me want to die even more I have anorexia I live with my family and they re putting immense pressure on me to function and go to school and do all this homework and I just can t function Not only that I m extremely sore right now from my scoliosis and I m pretty sure my period is starting I got ignored by my ex over text after wishing him a happy Halloween and asking him about exams He frequently breaks his phone so I sent it over Instagram and got left on seen I am grasping at threads in order to find a reason to live but things are genuinely so bad and rarely in my entire life have I ever caught a break I m thinking about admitting myself to hospital but I don t want to be cooped up and I don t even know if I want to live so it s kinda like what s the point On the other hand I m afraid and I genuinely feel I might do something I feel like I have a million problems I can t fix and I m drowning in school work and I genuinely don t think I want to continue living I don t know what to do Thanks for reading,"Cause of Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Mental Distress",medium

Guys this is important Cock and ball torture From Wikipedia the free encyclopedia at en wikipedia org https en wikipedia org Cock and ball torture CBT is a sexual activity involving application of pain or constriction to the male genitals This may involve directly painful activities such as genital piercing wax play genital spanking squeezing ball busting genital flogging urethral play tickle torture erotic electrostimulation or even kicking The recipient of such activities may receive direct physical pleasure via masochism or knowledge that the play is pleasing to a sadistic dominant Image Electrostimulation applied on a penis Contents Section In Pornography Section Ball stretcher Section Parachute Section Humbler Section Testicle cuff Section In pornography In addition to it s occasional role in BDSM pornography Tamakeri literally Ball kicking is a separate genre in Japan One notable actress in tamakeri is Erika Nagai who typically uses her martial arts skills to knee or kick men in the testicles Section Ball stretcher A ball stretcher is a sex toy that is fastened around a man in order to elongate the scrotum and provide a feeling of weight pulling the testicles away from the body While leather stretchers are most common other models are made of steel rings that are fastened with screws causing additional mildly uncomfortable weight to the wearer The length of the stretcher may vary from inches and the steel models can weigh as much as five pounds Section Parachute A Parachute is a small collar usually made from leather which fastens around the scrotum and from which weights can be hung Conical in shape three or four short chains hanging beneath to which weights can be attached Used as part of cock and ball torture within a BDSM relationship the parachute provides a constant drag and squeezing effects on the man s testicles Moderate weights of kg can be suspended especially during bondage Smaller weights can be used when the man is free to move when the swinging effect of the weight can restrict sudden movements as well as providing a visual stimulus for the dominant partner Section Humbler A humbler is a BDSM physical restraint device used to restrict the movement of a submissive male participant in a BDSM scene The humbler consists of a testicle cuff device which clamps around the base of the scrotum mounted in the center of a bar that passes behind the thighs at the base of the buttocks This forces the wearer to keep his legs forward as any attempt to to straighten the legs slightly pulls directly on the scrotum causing from considerable discomfort to extreme pain Section Testicle cuff A testicle cuff is a ring shaped device around the scrotum between the body and the testicles which when closed does not allow the testicles to slide through it A common type has two connected cuffs one around the scrotum and the other around the base of the penis They are just one of many devices to restrain the male genitalia A standard padlock may also be locked around the scrotum without the key it cannot be removed Some passive men enjoy the feeling of being owned while dominant individuals enjoy the sense of owning their partners Requiring such a man wear testicle cuffs symbolizes that his sexual organs belong to his partner who may be either male or female There is a level of humiliation involved by which they find sexual arousal The cuffs may even form part of a sexual fetish of the wearer or his partner However these are extreme uses of testicle cuffs More conventionally the device pulls down the testicles and keeps them there during stimulation which has a number of benefits Making the penis appear longer Pulling the testicles down and away from the base of the penis stretches the skin over the base of the penis and pubic bone exposing the additional inch or so of penile shaft that is normally hidden from view Improving sexual arousal While some men may be aroused by the feeling of being owned the physical feeling of stretching the ligaments that suspend the testicles has an effect similar to the more common practice of stretching one s legs and pointing the toes Preventing the testicles from lifting up so far that they become lodged under the skin immediately adjacent to the base of the penis a condition which can be very uncomfortable especially if the testicle is then squashed by the slap of skin during thrusting in sexual intercourse Delaying or intensifying ejaculation by preventing the testicles from rising normally to the point of no return It is much harder to reach an orgasm,"Cause of Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Positive Coping",medium

First times thinking about suicide recentlyBeen on antidepressants for half a year now things have only gotten worse since taking them Recently started thinking about what the repercussions of suicide would be and what would happen after i die How would I do it What s the quickest most efficient way that s least painful I don t even wanna act like I ve got some huge sob story and my life has been doomed from the start I m just sick of hating myself and wanting to be somebody else I m tired of waking up and wanting to go back to sleep even though I m not tired I wanna just sit in a metal box and stare at a wall for a long while I wanna just stop existing for a little while I m so burnt out Not even from school I m burnt out from life The nice thing about it all though is that I kinda like the power of not caring anymore I m about to graduate high school and go to my dream college and all I can help but think about is how much I don t care about my future anymore I don t care about the consequences of my life anymore It s nice to not care about all the little things that used to make me hate myself Now when I screw things up instead of feeling like crap and just think about how it won t matter in the long run since there won t be a long run A part of me hopes things get worse so I can just off myself and not have to care anymore so my fuck ups stop having power over my mentally ill brain,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update",high
"I suppose I just need a place to vent. The past year has been terrible, horrid. And even with summer rolling through, I feel this utter disgust at myself and who I am; it is no longer a probability that I was going through seasonal affective disorder or whatever it is called. I am at least not as severely depressed, but there really is not a day that goes by where I do not think about killing myself. I just think not many people in my circle, perhaps anyone, is really ready to have that conversation, even those who know of my feelings and thoughts. Of course, people are dealing with their own issues, especially during this pandemic, I just cannot help but feel like I have been going through these episodes of depression for the last five years. Five whole years of contemplating suicide. I am not alone in how I feel, but it never ceases to seem so isolating and that I am truly alone. Even getting a full time job did not make anything better; it dawned on me that this will be the rest of my life--wake up, work, eat, sleep. And everyday what I want to achieve and pursue seems that much farther away. Life cannot just be this, or else what is the point?

So why continue Ever since middle school I have wanted to commit suicide It s not gotten better I am in my final stretch of school at college I just want to end it My logic has shifted from I hate myself because I am an awful person who doesn t deserve to live to what s the point of living I figured it out I am just like everyone else We all have problems and we all have things we are good at and bad at That s fine There s no reason why I should hate myself But I do Every action I take causes me more sadness then happiness And the happiness I do attain never lasts more than a few days I ve tried medication and it makes everything worse Much worse What s the point of continuing on if the moments of happiness in life are drowned out by the sadness I feel of every day life I come into the world alone I go out alone I have a loving family amp caring friends I ve a bright future and I have almost a hundred grand to my name without so much as raising a finger to attain it I can t enjoy any of that Instead I focus on the fact that I can t enjoy it I focus on everything I do that s wrong regrettable past actions and why must I be hurtful towards anything I care about even if it s in jest I can be one of the nicest people and that s fine In fact I like making people happy because since I can t enjoy being happy at least I can window shop and watch your happiness What s the point of carrying on though It s as if everything I eat turns to ash The only reason I ve not killed myself just yet is because it s selfish and hurtful towards the people I care about I had a fairly disturbing thought process recently You always go out of your way for others Do something for yourself something you ve wanted since middle school Kill yourself I realize now that my preferred method for selfinflicted death is gunshot to the head Anything else would give me too much of a hesitation I have plenty to live for I don t want too I spend too much effort trying to accomplish my goals for things could make me happy I m tired of trying to be happy and failing constantly I can t make a moment of happiness last when I have an ocean of painful things to remember or harp on Even if it s not from that ocean I can look at other perspectives of my life and be disappointed in myself Ignoring the introspective causes of depression in my life another source is the complete meaningless of my life I work semi hard to attain certain goals and values and once completed the joy is rather limited but still existent However I am tired I am tired of work at the age of The rest of my life will be filled with nothing but work till I retire Wake up work sleep Repeat Why That s such a mind numbing task to endure for the rest of my for see able future It s definitely not something to look forward too I don t want to be alive if I am going to be forced to work for the rest of my life Fun fact I ve been commited to the hospital for self harm in fifth grade and have attempted suicide four times my last attempt being senior of highschool I used to cut myself I ve been put on antidepressants three times all with no real effect I was offered to moderate this place a while back I said no because this was gonna be hard to tell other people you should be alive when I didn t want to Of course the reason I gave MWM for my decline was that this place was far too depressing TL DR The emotions caused by the negatives of life outweigh the emotions by the positive So why carry on I want to stop putting effort into being alive It s far too much work and appears to have little to no pay off,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update",high

My girlfriend told my family about my suicidal thoughtsSo recently I ve been having more suicide thoughts so much so that I ve been thinking about doing it times this week Everytime I have these thoughts I tell my girlfriend about it and she usually calms me down and talks to me about it But today i was at my girlfriend s house and she got mad at me about something I did that made us not able to go on this huge date that we ve been planning She got really mad at me and started yelling at me which she had never done before I of course get super insecure about this and my suicidal thoughts kick in because of the kinds of things she s saying I start crying and she sees and immediately stops comes by my side and starts apologizing profusely for the things she said My suicidal thoughts were probably the worst they ve ever at then and i just couldn t control myself I was just curled up on her couch crying replaying the things she said in my mind over and over again Meanwhile she s trying to get the thoughts to leave my head by talking to me and trying to calm me down but its not working Then after about minutes I tell her im actually wanting to kill myself like I was going to do it later that day She starts crying and sends a text to my mom to come over to her house asap My mom comes and my gf tells her about my suicidal thoughts My mom talks to me about it and asks my gf to come over to my house so she can talk with the whole family about it She comes and she sits down with my parents and brother about whats going on with me They react very caringly and tell me they are here for me and that if I need to see a therapist I can This was the first time I ever talk to my family about this and I was super scared of doing it I was afraid they would judge me get mad at me or something but they were really helpfully and showed they cared about it Hopefully seeing a therapist would help my depression and suicidal tendencies Edit Thank you guys for the responses I m honestly a bit scared for the future but if I get better at the end of all this then it will be worth it,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update",high

here s my debate for why violent video games reduce violence IRL I m having a debate competition and the motion is this house believes that violent video games lead to violent acts in young audiences so o figured this would be of some help against the banvideogames subreddit it s not too good rn most of the time we commit violent acts because we re angry or frustrated by commiting violent acts in the game we vent these emotions out in the game instead of in the real world say for example DOOM you know the drill we all like BFG division you might say that video games can culture some really toxic people but speaking into a mic and speaking to a face are two different things I have friends that literally gang up on me and ban me from their Minecraft server because they were in a bad mood the next day I had a few words to say to them and they just stood there and let me run my mouth I just didn t feel like letting them have their way so I did a thing that s why I think cyberbullying isn t a problem if you know how to treat is properly my own opinion you guys might know something I don t can someone please improve on this and post it elsewhere I m not a good writer I just started out the debate,"Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Seeking Help",medium

Most days my brain is just silently AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIt s like this indescribable emotional pain mixed with an intense almost overwhelming desire for life to end all resulting in a feeling as if there s a corner of my brain just screaming endlessly TL DR Shoutout to everyone here trying to get on with life with a brain that wants to die Posting here because I can t act anymore I can t pretend that everything is okay I ve gained kg in a week from eating rubbish which is super yuck but I also don t care because my brain has been swamped by intense suicidal ideation and if I m not sufficiently distracted the thoughts about suicide come back in like BLAM BLAM BLAM BLAM just drowning out everything else I think about self harming a lot I mean not only suicide but other forms of physical pain But then I remember I ve got way too many scars already and additional scars and a high pain tolerance doesn t change anything I don t have a good reason to want to die There s no major crisis The relationship breakdown was over months ago and I m mostly over that I have enough money for everything I essentially need Sure I ll probably need several more major operations because genetics suck and I ll definitely need a double mastectomy at some point because cancer risk but that s not it either It s not even the fact that I have about three friends and the last time I hung out with a friend was in February because at the moment people are too exhausting for me to want to have any interaction with I don t want anything to do with anyone right now I can t pretend to not be depressed when I m around other people anymore It takes all of my energy to pretend to be normal and smile and laugh at work and I know I don t do a very good job at that as it is It s not really any of that I just don t care anymore About any of it Any of life I am amazed I have been together enough to do things like shower and brush my teeth and pay bills and work days a week Do look pale and run down as shit though Going through the motions I guess while my brain is screaming I want to die all the while It s gotten to the point where I m thinking about suicide all day every day I suspect it s the general anaesthetic I had from a colonoscopy in May sending me off the deep end into post operative depression but also the general state of the world Now I know if I stopped eating crap and did more exercise and got more sunshine and made more of an effort to be social I d probably feel better But it also gets to a point where you cannot bring yourself to do any of that because just getting dressed and maintaining basic personal hygiene is a mammoth achievement So I am going to my GP on Monday to ask to go back on antidepressants It might be a complete waste of time and money as it has been in the past but I can t help hoping that this time will be different that this time maybe we ll try a different drug that might actually give me the capacity to overcome the intrusive suicidal thoughts and do the exercise and the things I know I need to do for wellbeing Also going to see the psychologist on Monday It s been difficult to get an appointment a because it s bloody expensive and b because a huge chunk of the general population are under huge stresses so she s super busy and hard to get into I m hoping I have the money to continue to see her because she s the best psychologist I have ever seen I haven t kept it up because of financial stress and my mental health has suffered as a result But I think this time I should be able to stick with it for a while It s been hard because the depression has screwed with my cognitive function and sleep again too I can t concentrate for more than seconds I m agitated and drowning in anxiety all the time I go to sleep late and wake up early whether I like it or not I can t remember anything and everything takes me ten times longer to process or understand than usual and I constantly feel as dumb as a rock I wasn t entirely honest with my doctor last time I went because I didn t want to be on antidepressants again and I sure as hell didn t want to run the risk of being put in a mental hospital again But at the moment it s gotten to the point where I just don t care about anything anymore so might as well be totally upfront I think I m too lazy to actually kill myself Having been there and tried that more than once getting it right takes a lot of planning and organising and logistics I just don t have the energy for Especially because were I to go through with one of the plans for suicide I have I don t want to leave all my stuff just around for my family to deal with I d need to sort out my belongings and affairs etc etc etc and make sure I had enough money to cover any potential funeral or medical expenses if I fucked it up And that s the nub of it Human beings are both incredibly resilient and incredibly fragile creatures I think what keeps me going at times like these is that I know if I failed suicide where I was left half brain dead and still aware that that would be a fate far worse than this My life could be x worse than it currently is no doubt But knowing that doesn t change that incessant suicidal impulse blamming it s way across my brain I just wanted to put this out there because I needed to tell someone how I feel right now with completely honesty And maybe someone else will resonate with how I feel right now and it might help them feel they re not alone,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Progress Update, Seeking Help",high
