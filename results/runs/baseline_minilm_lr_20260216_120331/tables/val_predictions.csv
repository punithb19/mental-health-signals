"anxiety and travel anxiety i am new to the anxiety world and unfortunately it has come on so strong and intense this year my fiancÃ©s family travels and i had my first trip with them this february to breckenridge i ended up with acute altitude sickness hospitalized lost close to 12 pounds in five days and spent weeks recovering now i am anxious every time i go anywhere further than an hour from my home we leave for scotland in three weeks and for reference i am with them this weekend two hours from home with the most severe anxiety and depression symptoms iâ€™ve ever experienced to the point where iâ€™d like to go to a hospital just so someone can sedate me 
 also my fiancÃ©s family is wonderful they in no part make me feel any anxiety or stress and are incredibly understanding 
 i am hopefully seeing a therapist this week as well as my primary care doctor to see what to do i suffer from high blood pressure as well which introduces another scary factor into the anxiety cocktail iâ€™m facing i take atenolol beta blocker and amlodopine daily which is actually supposed to help the anxiety however i think iâ€™ve just soared into the next level recently 
 any tips and tricks are appreciated i have an oura ring to track my stress but sometimes feel like i get so wrapped up in the data i stress myself out more 
 
 apologies for the novel typing this out actually felt very therapeutic and calmed me down

"I do not even know what to write here or where to start..Excuse for my English proficiency as its not my first language.For the past 5 years I had toxic parents and I have been in toxic relationships. My way of thinking about life, my will and reasoning were drastic and still are. The way I dealt with deppresion were drugs, cutting my wrist, risking life while walking on the edge of a building. A few years ago I tried to drown myself underneath the ice, hoping that I would not find the exit if I decided to live ( as I was almost drowning I found fisherman's hole through which I was able to break through and survive )I would not call myself dumb as I have created a few businesses (which failed eventually as I did not invest enough time and money) and now work as a programmer in a company which pays me good, but I failed my native language exams. I will not get my diploma and I will not enroll in the university. My mom recently went into psychosis which is not getting better. it is really hard to decide how I feel about that as I hated her most of my life, but we had our moments. My dad seems depressed too, I have two younger sisters and it is really hard to see him and I struggle to take care of them. I keep failing my driving exams. When taking them I start to feel really anxious and just stop the exam as my clutch leg starts ticking uncontrollably.I cannot stop thinking about suicide and my morality about it. I know that I have to support the family, live for my friends too, but it just overwhelms me.Now at nights I just drug myself until I pass out while listening to music and it is the only way I can keep my thoughts away from suicide. I have tried a few psychologist, they did not really help me. I do not know what to do. it is so hard to stay alive.I just wanted to, I dunno, share my pain or just talk to someone.

I desperately need help Hello I m a years old male college student I don t know where to begin I ll spare you my family problems I got over them I don t even know how to properly describe my situation I have no girlfriend nor I had many in the past I had two relationships that lasted less than a week when I was and the last one ended badly Six months ago I found out that my girlfriend of five months was cheating on me with two guys at the same time throught the whole period she spent with me She told me she felt pity for me and didn t want to dump me but she didn t really like me I fell as down as I ve ever fallen before as soon as she said that to me Even though I m socially akward I am also a good liar and I managed to make everyone believe I was fine confident and manly I didn t want my friends to feel bad for me so I dealt with my feelings when I was alone and faked confidence when I was with them My male friends constantly ask me for advices on how to be more like me because they think that I don t talk a lot because I m mysterious and other utter bullcrap like that They make me look cooler than I really am The reality is that I m a messed up guy who can t even talk without doing something cringyin and says that girls are not his priority to look cool just so that people don t wonder why he doesn t have one I cry myself to sleep everynight I usually sleep one to two hours everynight because of all the shit that goes on in my head Drinking wine has helped me with the thoughts and the insomnia but I ve recently stopped because I m scared of going down the alcoholic route which would make me feel even more pathetic These six months have been the darkest of my life so far All of my male friends have a girlfriend talk to me about how happy they are and I have to pretend I m happy for them In reality I just wish they all lost whatever they have out of jelousy I ve dumped all of my female friends because I m slowly becoming obsessed with not being friendzoned by girls Whenever an attractive friend of mine came up to me for advice I instantly felt like shit because she is treating me like a female friend Even newly met girls do that They don t even find me interesting enough to even consider dating me and straight up see me as an emotional dumpster The worst thing is that I actually try not to make myself view like that by avoiding giving advices and being the classic nice guy I am so not interesting that they fucking put me in the friendzone The last drop was today I ve been chatting with this girl for a couple of days she seemed interested since she always initiated contact touched me asked me very personal questions and in general her body language was telling me that she was interested I followed my usual line of thoughts by faking confidence and pretending my life was all good and interesting also because I have no interest in boring a stranger to death with my personal problems Today she hugged me and told me she loves me like a fucking brother I ve managed to put myself in the friendzone in not even a fucking week I don t know I just don t know She is now texting me and I don t want to answer her because I know she wants a friendship out of me and I do not want to give her that My pride is no more I don t want to talk about it with my friends because the way they see me is probably the only one good thing about my life I m also supposed to go to a party tonight and she is going to be there I think I ll stay home I don t know,"Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Positive Coping, Seeking Help, Progress Update, Mood Tracking, Cause of Distress","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Maladaptive Coping, Mental Distress, Mood Tracking, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

I wrote an abomination D Dr Blivious Brainwits was a man who liked tall women likely connected to his long standing slenderman fetish He sat alone at his booth staring across the club at his desired woman She too was sitting alone at another booth drinking a glass filled with some red liquid Blivious wondered what it was Perhaps I should ask her he thought It could serve as an excuse to introduce myself With that he gulped down the remainder of his beverage which was a strong mixture of whiskey and soy sauce It was an acquired taste but quite a good one for those capable of enjoying it He slid out of the booth and weaved his way clumsily through the crowd of club goers dancing to the emo trap bangers that the dj kept playing The track currently being played was pure fire a song called Helena Remix by My Chemical Romance and Metro Boomin featuring Savage The doctor soon found it difficult to tame his hips which had an incredible desire to begin swinging to the beat He pinched himself on the back of his left hand reminding himself of the task at hand the woman Nothing else mattered With newfound confidence he found himself able to resist dancing to the infectious club banger He walked over to the booth of the young woman and sat across from her May I ask madam what you are drinking He said smoothly speaking in a heavy British accent He flashed an awkward smile revealing his polished white teeth and unhealthy blood red gums The contrast was frightening He winked at her Take a sip she said as she pushed her glass towards Blivious He took it and had a short sip It tasted strongly of ketchup It was a local brew the Ketchbrau a ketchup infused beer The doctor raised one eyebrow and proceeded to gulp down the rest of the Ketchbrau in seconds Um sir The woman began That was my Yes yes Blivious waved his hand dismissively I shall buy you another madam he said with a strong Russian accent Tis will only take a moment m lady He stood up and went towards the bar As he walked he bulged his chest feeling prideful about the progress he had made with the woman All signs were looking good One Ketchbrau over here kind sir He cried at the bartender who nodded in response Actually he added Make it two Ketchbrau After receiving the drinks Blivious returned to the woman s booth He slid one drink towards her and she sipped it slowly as she eyed him suspiciously So she said I d appreciate it if you d introduce yourself She squinted at him Very well madam He said with a heavy French accent The woman frowned at the sudden accent change You are speaking to the widely acclaimed Dr Blivious Brainwits I have a Ph D He smiled Charmed yet madam He smiled even wider His gums appeared to stretch almost as if they may split in half It was frightening The woman frowned even harder making it appear as if she now had a unibrow So now that you know my credentials madam may I know yours He pulled a wooden pipe from his pocket and brought it to his lips He lit the pipe and began sucking down the fumes of the poison ivy he was smoking Not a single trace of smoke escaped from his lips He felt his lungs burning within his chest Seeing this the woman frowned further still her forehead becoming wrinkled and distorted from the effort Her forehead looked like that of an old woman I m uh call me Lindsey Lindsey Cocksworth She said still frowning Cocksworth Asked Blivious surprised Cocksworth sounds like a good sign he thought He smiled to himself Erm no I mean yes she blushed Blivious pulled his pipe from his mouth and put it to his nose inhaling the fumes It tickled the inside of his face Lindsey frowned even further her forehead contorting beyond what should have been humanly possible It was a horrible sight to behold Interesting surname madam May I ask of its origins He raised one eyebrow taking on a sensual and suggestive expression Well the woman suddenly stopped frowning and began smiling instead Want to find out doctor She winked Blivious suddenly felt something bulging in his underwear It was a sensation he hadn t felt in a long time Oh madam he gasped That is quite the suggestion I just may have to take you up on that offer He shifted in his booth leaning in closer to the woman Gladly Blivious sped down the street in his Lamborghini Corvette hybrid the Lamborvette It was a custom vehicle of his own design Lindsey sat in the passenger seat singing along to every emo trap banger that came on the radio She had been singing along to DaBaby s BOP Remix featuring Gerard Way and Travis Barker when they pulled into the doctor s driveway Blivious stepped out of his car and began walking towards the front door Lindsey close behind He slid the key in opening the door and turned to watch Lindsey as she walked towards him Despite the darkness of the night he thought he could see something protruding from between her legs Blivious blinked and rubbed his eyes thinking he was imagining things Lindsey walked into the house with the doctor who shut the door behind them The woman instantly pushed Blivious onto the couch asserting her dominance She let out a low inhuman growl Blivious was lying on his back looking up at the woman as she stripped her clothes off He smiled at her Until he saw her cock It was a massive juicy thick hunk of meat far beyond the length and girth of the average penis It was almost two feet long and several inches wide Blivious was about to stand up and run away but Lindey s growls intimated him and he dared not make a move As she growled he suddenly realized that her mouth was not moving He looked at her penis and realized the head of the penis had a mouth reminiscent of that of a dog Ma mad madam Blivious stuttered You you Silence She cried speaking from both her mouth and her penis at the same time The voice coming from her mouth was shrill and high while that of her cock was low and gritty They spoke in perfect unison I did not sign up for this madam He yelled using a heavy Nigerian accent GrrrrrrRAOW the penis said The woman looked down and began patting her penis as if it were a pet Shh she whispered to her cock Her cock grumbled in return Seeing her distracted the doctor made a run for it He rolled off the couch and quickly got to his feet sprinting to the door He had almost made it No No Madam you can t I can she said as she dragged him by his leg back towards the couch She let out a sinister cackle Nothing will stop me Blivious whimpered in despair as Lindsey tore his shirt off She began gripping and yanking on his pants struggling to pull them off as he squirmed desperately on the couch Her cock was now fully erect it s length almost five feet as it angled diagonally upwards Strangely enough however her balls were a normal size Lindsey had now ripped off Blivious s pants and underwear revealing his erect three inch dick She gripped her own penis and angled it down towards his The mouth of her penis licked it s lips preparing to give Blivious a penis to penis blowjob as tears streamed down his cheeks Her medium sized boobs began bouncing up and down by themselves as if they had a mind of their own Her nipples suddenly cracked and opened into two tiny mouths squealing excitedly Suddenly when he thought all hope had been lost Blivious had an idea He looked over towards his Amazon Echo device resting atop a table in the corner of the room Alexa He yelled Play an emo trap banger Lindsey s penis lips were only an inch away from his cock when his speakers began blasting music catching her off guard and startling her The song that began playing was WAP Remix by Cardi B and Jonathan Davis featuring Machine Gun Kelly Instantly Lindsey leapt back and away from Blivious She began uncontrollably bucking her hips front to back and side to side falling victim to the club banger Noooo She cried in protest as she began flailing and bouncing uncontrollably around the room in time with the music Ha You have been bested madam Said the doctor speaking in a thick Southern accent N not not possible Lindsey screamed Tis quite possible indeed madam He said as he stood up He put his clothes back on while the woman continued dancing uncontrollably Her penis was no longer erect and had gone back to being only three feet long and dangling He pulled his pipe from his pocket and began smoking The woman was now curled up in a ball in the corner of the room struggling to try and stop herself from dancing Blivious walked up to her and shoved his pipe up her penis mouth It howled in pain as it was lit on fire and began burning from the inside out By the time the song ended Lindsey was little more than a burnt up crusty corpse Blivious put his hands on his hips and smiled to himself Another job well done,"Critical Risk, Positive Coping, Seeking Help, Progress Update, Mood Tracking, Cause of Distress","Miscellaneous, Positive Coping, Progress Update"

I was born a burdenI ve always felt like a burden Whether it be the medical bills to the food to the clothing I ve just always been a detriment to my family I don t live lavishly I let my sister and mother and father live the life they can Part of that life includes reminding me how much money I ve l c ost my parents My mother has always been this way and up until recently I had just had to deal with it I grew depressed and eventually turned to drugs and alcohol However I always kept a fine GPA and stayed in tune with what I was good with and kept working on my various side projects That became too much for me and I looked into moving in with my father for the time being due to the fact that my mother had become unbearable My father a much more timid spirit could continue to talk to me in a serious conversation instead of devolving from worried to screaming like my mother I ve gone to many different therapists to help with family problems depression and some mental troubles I was diagnosed with schizophrenia earlier last year and instead of helping me my parents decided it was in their better interests to ignore it and because of this I currently have to wake up in the morning and suffer every second while I m awake until I sleep which turns into a hour turn and toss fest until I wake up and don t have the will to try sleeping again To get to work and school my father helped me buy a car No longer can I tell if he continually reminds me of the car s price and how much he could ve done for himself with the money I want to pay him back as soon as possible but I am in no position to even start dealing with that matter My mother can t be trusted She goes out of her way to make my life harder She will call and text me every hours asking if I m available for dinner or some sort of meeting where when I decide to meet her she will spend as long as she can doing her best to remind me that she gave birth to me and it was the worst mistake in her entire life I no barely eat at this point because I m afraid to walk into the kitchen and make food out of ingredients I didn t purchase and I m barely making enough money to pay for school and gas as it is I cry on average or times a day but I think it s just a bad habit because I haven t gained anything from it yet I still consider suicide every day but it s not feasible when considering the position I am in It s selfish I read that suicide has a greater chance of hurting me long term over killing me If I attempt suicide I d probably mess it up and end up becoming a figure that sits in bed all day and drains my parents money on medical bills If I do somehow succeed with suicide my parents will end up having to pay my funeral expenses At this point in life I m slowly building up the money so I can safely move away and cut all contact with my family Maybe I won t be happy but they can be I m lost,"Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Positive Coping, Seeking Help, Progress Update, Mood Tracking, Cause of Distress","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Maladaptive Coping, Mental Distress, Mood Tracking, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

I got into a fender bender today For those that dont know a fender bender is a car crash which results in damage greater than a nick or scratch and always has damaged body panels pretty self explanatory I got hit from behind while I was at a yeild trying to merge into the flow of traffic Somehow the old lady who ran into me didn t know I was there and tried to force herself into the flow of traffic but I was in the way Fortunately I was working at the time and was driving around a company van so I don t have to worry about repairing my personal car The impact was at pretty low speed I was stopped and she was doing probably under km h mph so no one was seriously hurt The intersection that I got hit is a really badly designed intercession with big blindspots and lots of fast moving traffic so it wouldn t be uncommon for me to see an accident there once every couple weeks I drive around my home city delivering auto parts for a living so it was more a matter of when rather than if Still this was my first car accident either driver or passenger Scared the living shit out of me The van I was driving is fine it just needs a new bumper and a couple of new back doors The check engine light didn t even come on If I could properly latch the back doors I couldve kept driving it around and couldn t care less Her SUV was a little more beat up though as it looks like itll need a new bumper rad oil cooler a c condensor etc She actually took the plastic facia of my back bumper off and it was stuck in her grill when I got out to look I m glad that she didn t get hurt she was probably ish years old She was the first thing I checked on after I made sure that we were both parked off to the side of the road A young man like me can heal but someone her age would take a bit of effort to recover No witnesses decided to stop and help I guess they couldn t be bothered It s a shame but unfortunately not uncommon in my city For the first couple of hours after the accident my adrenaline was running really high I could barely write down the other drivers info my hands were shaking so bad so I didn t really feel anything but it s been about hours since the accident and now my lower to mid back has really stiffened up and is giving me some grief Don t worry though I ve already booked an appointment with my family doctor for tomorrow to see if any real damage has decided to show up Sorry for the rant I needed to talk to someone about it and get all the details out,"Mental Distress, Seeking Help, Progress Update, Mood Tracking","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Miscellaneous, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

I m nothing and I won t have anything enjoyable in my life Firstly I m sorry for my bad English but I m not a native speaker So I m years old boy and I ve been planning to commit suicide for couple of months I would probably do it already if not the fact that I doesn t want to hurt my mother and my friend Maybe you re wondering why such a young lad like me is willing to do that Well I would rather ask Why shouldn t I There is no happiness for me now or in the future I think every person consciously or unconsciously is seeking for happiness so what s the point of living where there is no hope for me to be a happy man I don t know if happiness isn t destined for me or I just not capable enough to reach it but does it really matter There s is not a good thing waiting for me period Everyone perceive happiness as a different thing For me happiness comes from social interactions and from making different people happy It may sound a little bit ironic considering the fact that I have to cope with terrible anxiety general akwardness and introversion Maybe that s the reason why I want to commit suicide happiness for me comes from a thing that I m not able to do I was thinking about becoming an writer That s a way right People will enjoy my books and everything will be fine Well there s the problem I m not good enough to make it work Although I enjoy writing what s the fucking point if it doesn t reach wider public Secondly I know it my sound kind of cheesy but I don t think I can reach happiness without having a girlfriend And for me having someone like that is not almost impossible it is just impossible There are various reasons for that I m ugly and overweight I m shy and introvertic I m bad at having conversations I m kind of a weirdo I don t like generic music and stuff etc It is so painful for me that no women will ever love me it s so fucking painful man And it s really not about sex I don t give a fuck about sex I can quickly jerk off and all of my lust is gone It s about love and everything that comes with that For the end I m just gonna say wish me that someday I will gain enough braveness to finally jump off the bridge,"Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Mood Tracking, Cause of Distress","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Mood Tracking, Positive Coping"

Girlfriend has tried to commit suicide twice in a monthHi everyone My girlfriend is an absolutely wonderful person with an absolutely horrific past She has gone through things I would not wish on my worst enemy She suffers from severe depression and bipolar Lately she has been feeling very worthless because of her job and not having a degree She was on the right track though she enrolled to go back to school to become a Vet Tech Things seemed like they were getting better But late last month she made her first suicide attempt I rushed her to the ER and she was sent to Inpatient for a few days It seemed to really do her a lot of good They changed her medication and set her up with a counselor Things were going fine for several weeks but yesterday we got back from a really nice vacation and as I was trying to go to bed she was in the other room writing her suicide note and taking about pills I had a bad feeling so I went to check on her and she was really out of it I rushed her to the ER and she will be there for a few days until they can transfer her back to inpatient I just dont know what to do She lives with me because her family is horrible I am her main source of support But I also struggle with anxiety and depression I can barely take care of myself I am also fairly young I have a decent job so I can support us both but it is so tough I want her to get help but I feel that having her at my apartment is not the best for her since I work so much I feel like im tearing myself apart worrying about her all the time And after this last attempt I am going to feel so uneasy leaving her alone anymore I constantly worry I am going to come home one day to find her lifeless,"Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Seeking Help, Progress Update, Mood Tracking, Cause of Distress","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Maladaptive Coping, Mental Distress, Mood Tracking, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

Trying to stay strong but don t know what my options are and I don t want to throw my life away I ve had a long history with depression and anxiety and usually I m able to push through until things stabilize again and enjoy life until the next wave hits Another wave hit a few weeks ago and this one hit hard Hard enough that it was the first time I ve taken action and woke up next to a a spilt bottle of pills and vodka and dry heaved for about an hour before calling into work sick the next two days This scared the shit out of me Scared me enough that I haven t touched alcohol in the past two weeks But I still feel just as bad as I did that day and I don t want whatever snapped inside of me that night to happen again About six months ago I started a new job I knew it would be a challenge but it was an opportunity I couldn t turn down Lately I can barely make myself show up to even fill the spot at the desk You know when you just made a huge mistake and feel your stomach tighten up That s how I feel all the time My depression is affecting my performance which makes me feel even worse and I know people are noticing I want to do better but I just can t right now and I m afraid they ll either find someone that can do better or I ll drive myself to snap again I don t want to feel like a failure and certainly not because of my stupid brain But I don t know what my options are If I keep grinding I m afraid I ll snap again soon If I leave I ll ruin this opportunity and possible future ones because I m leaving after only months for unclear reasons I don t want to throw my career away but I never want to end up where I was a couple of weeks ago again either And I don t know how to do both right now,"Mental Distress, Seeking Help, Progress Update, Mood Tracking, Cause of Distress","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Maladaptive Coping, Mental Distress, Mood Tracking, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

I want to end my lifeI just need to vent I have no one I can tell this to I moved back home to my grandmas after a stressful two years of college and a failed relationship due to drug addiction on both parties We were both insanely depressed I thought I did the good thing moving back home but everyday still feels worse I miss him so much it hurts He just overdosed again two weeks ago and I heard he s doing better but I ve decided to go no contact but I miss him so bad maybe I ll do minimal contact once he s feeling better I ve had suicidal thoughts in the past but it s gone out of control since moving back home My life has no direction or meaning All I do is bother everyone My mind is so hazy that I cannot focus Getting out of bed is insanely difficult Going out in public feels like everyone is either scurrying away from me or staring at me I know it s my head playing with me man I feel like a monster and it feels like everyone can see it It s hard making friends and I don t want to bother my friends down here I had a decent job paying me an hour but it was insanely stressful when I moved back home I applied to jobs near me and quickly got one as a front desk agent at a nice hotel paying me dollars an hour It s definitely slower paced and cool but the down time is absolutely killing me My thoughts eat my alive I hooked up with an ex two nights ago because I craved being touched but obviously I feel x worse The sex was meaningless he was just ramming my cervix the whole time but I didn t want to ruin the moment or make him mad by saying it hurt so I just waited for it to end We smoked after and chatted for a bit Played some video games and cuddled and fell asleep well he did but I just stared at the wall for hours It felt so good to be high again Yesterday morning at work I was really irritated because my cervix feels insanely sore I got no sleep and my emotions are completely out of control I m usually sweet but I felt like a ticking time bomb all day Housekeepers told me to call my boss so they could print their reports because no managers were there I told them to call them because I was busy but they stood behind me for minutes while I took phone calls and did my paperwork because they re english is bad and they wanted me to do it they were communicating with me just fine So I snapped and said what do you want me to do Did y all call them like i told you they said they called the gm and my boss but they didn t answer their phones and they left a voicemail So I dialed the sales manager because i knew she was awake because she called me earlier and she gave me an attitude on the phone and she dates my boss so he got on the phone and yelled at me not to call her I said I only called her because him and the other boss didn t answer their phones and to never speak to me in that tone again and maybe they shouldn t tell us to call them whenever they aren t there if we need help if they don t want to help So what s the point in their numbers posted on the bulletin board I ripped it off and told the housekeepers that I can t help them and to please go away I had so much downtime of just standing there and reading news articles that I opened word and typed how I was feeling It wasn t meant to be a suicide note but I did mention how I wanted to do it Which is unimportant but if anyone is interested I want to drive far away listening to music until I m tired then I want to drive into a body of water and drown I don t know when I ll do it but I fantasize about it every day I drive home from work I m too coward to shoot myself or hang myself I don t want my family to find me If my body is found I want my ashes to be spread in fields of flowers and trees I thought I closed the word document but I have ADHD and would lose my head if it wasn t attached to my body So I had anxiety all yesterday that I left the document open and my boss who yelled at me called me at last night and I m wondering if that is why Why else call me at that hour Maybe I m overthinking So now I m thinking should I not show up to work Maybe have a me day I don t even know how to have a self care and love day I m just too scared to go to work I don t know if anyone would even care to read this I feel so lost and lonely If anyone wants to talk I d be so happy to,"Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Positive Coping, Seeking Help, Progress Update, Mood Tracking, Cause of Distress","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Maladaptive Coping, Mental Distress, Mood Tracking, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

"Two days ago I posted something so cute about hitting 76 days clean and now I’m all fucked up. Idk what happened but my bf (LDR) said that he wanted to shorten my trip length from a week to just a weekend. This changed comes after about a week of him acting really weird, he says he’s got a concussion but he worked and drank too much making it worse. I was ok with that but I wish he told me before when he was acting weird so I knew. 
 
 He wasn’t talking to me or texting me as much as he used to saying he needs to minimize phone time or he just doesn’t use his phone when he’s out or with fam or friends but he’s with them 24/7!! The phone is literally how we communicate and how this relationship works!! I felt abandoned like he just didn’t care bc he refused to compromise, we went from talking ~1-2 hr on the phone each day and like 500???? texts to like ~30 min on the phone and 100 texts a day. 
 
 I really hurt. I felt alone. He has so much time with his friends and family in person and I don’t ever get to see him, and he still wants to shorten our trip that is literally still a week and a half away bc of his concussion when he literally does the same stuff we’d be doing maybe even more when I came up. He says he needs to feel independent but I’m literally 1000 miles away and am just ducking asking for 8% of ur time every day. 
 
 He knew I had BPD from the start but I have genuinely been able to control it better than ever before until tonight. I just feel like he’s making excuses to not talk to me and not let me come up anymore, but why? You know what my mind jumps to… I believe him when he says he had a concussion but I really just feel like he changed into a different person. He went from being the perfect person everyone loved him promising me everything caring and understanding and now he acts like I’m fucking disgusting and he hates me. 
 
 Tonight he promised me that I would have a chance to call and talk to him for a while, but then he called late and said he was tired and needed to go to sleep to rest up instead but then I texted him a little later and he texted back and he had just been chilling with his brother who he sees CONSTANTLY. And then called his friend instead of talking to me after promising me!! He always sees and talks to these people he lives so close to them! He literally just acts like he fucking hates me and I’ve kept it together for a fucking week and a half and I really just wanted to fuckinf see him for enough time. 
 
 I called him over and over and he blocked me and made his cousin block me and I just SH. Fuck it. Im so sick and tired of everything. Ok goodnight.",Cause of Distress,"Cause of Distress, Positive Coping, Seeking Help"

"I have had anxiety, depression and mental illness much of my life. I have not been able to get proper treatment at my local mental health clinic. In some ways they have helped me immensely. I have been able to get my pure obsessional OCD under control so I no longer have such bad symptoms. It still definitely is there and sometimes flares up a bit, but it is just faded background noise for the most part. In other ways my mental health has significantly deteriorated. In the mid-2010s I completely lost the self confidence I had gained during my time in college when I found my tribe and got better in my art skills. I could not finish college and had to drop out due to my mental illness and ADHD and have been trying to get by as a freelance artist. I am mostly living on disability though and have not been able to earn anything close to a living wage. If I would attempted this without financial aid from the government, I would be living with my parents. And if my parents had not supported me, god knows where I would be. I would probably be homeless, which I know happened to a college friend of mine. His parents did not support his artistic pursuits and he had to quit school because they would kicked him out. My mental health is in very bad shape and has been for several years now. Since 2017 I have been completely incapacitated by the co-morbid disorders I have been dealing with. I have severe social anxiety, agoraphobia, body dysmorphic disorder, as well as ADHD and autism spectrum disorder. I also have C-PTSD. My parents have to drive me everywhere because driving terrifies me and I cannot even call a taxi because of my social anxiety and C-PTSD - which makes me terrified of being in a space with people I do not know where there is no quick exit - sitting with a taxi driver would mean I would be unable to escape easily if they turned out to be mean - I know it is highly unlikely but it still scares me. My friend had one experience with a mean taxi driver when she was in her late teens.So I had the crazy idea of trying out a drawing/art video blog, as it seems to be lucrative and you tubers earn a passive income, which I think would be great instead of just relying on government financial aid. I want to do it but I do not think I would be any good at it. It actually seems impossible for me because even though I have decent drawing skills, I have no people skills. I am socially handicapped by my mental disorders. One of the main reasons I draw is because I have such a hard time talking to people and drawing helps make me feel more comfortable around them. I have no idea how I would ever feel comfortable enough to talk on camera and not scare people away. I do not want to be insincere or fake and pretend to be more talkative and bubbly than I am. I have actually thought of doing a voice changer thing or just captions as talking just scares the hell out of me. I am scared of my voice or name being recognized by bullies and being stalked and harassed in real life or online. I may try one video and perhaps not even post it but just get a feel for it and if it does not work I will not bother. It is a multi-skilled vocation to be an art vlogger. You have to also have good people skills as well as video-making skills. I hate the idea of only video blogging with the hope of earning money but hating people. I like it when the youtuber is genuinely friendly and acknowledges their followers and all that. I would not want to put people off with my unfriendliness from social anxiety and not responding to comments or messages, or turning off comments. I just do not really know what to do with myself. I am not cut out for this existence. I feel powerless, I am a mess and do not know how to prevent my life from going to sh*t","Cause of Distress, Mental Distress","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

Concerned for a friend our conversation has left me shaken up I want to start from the beginning I apologize early on if the information is not needed I will try to get to our conversation that just happened a few minutes ago quickly Sorry if the formatting and paragraphing is weird I play online video games quite a lot This has led me to meet plenty of people who come in and out of my life a lot Except for one of my friends who we will call James We have talked and played together for a little over a year now This has caused a pretty good relationship to grow between us We text call each other and even video chat on the occasion James is and lives in another state than I Because we have grown so close we talk a lot about things that happen in real life and about our pasts He mentioned to me that he has attempted suicide before but was saved and generally during our relationship he was never depressed or has ever shown any signs that he is still feeling like killing himself It all started a about months ago when he got together with this woman they dated for a few weeks and he made her pretty happy He often makes the mistake of falling to quickly and deeply in love When they broke up he was very depressed the only time we would ever talk was when he was completely intoxicated We went through a period where he would never answer calls or texts from me even Finally some good things happened in his life that brought him up and we were talking again Just weeks ago he decided to try dating again He met a girl via a dating app They talked non stop which made him smile and laugh and REALLY made a difference in him that even I could see from a few states away They met each other in person as she only lived an hour away from him and everything was going great He was talking about how much he loved her I don t know if he told her that and how she could be the one he marries I didn t want to ruin his fun as it was nice to see him happy so I did not say anything to him about how soon it was to make statements like that They broke up yesterday He had text me very early in the morning when I was sleeping and I didn t get the text for another hours All it said was I need someone right now I felt terrible because somehow I knew what happened I gave him a call no answer I text him no answer so I called him again and he answered saying he was at a friends getting drunk I asked if he was okay and he explained to me what happened They broke up because her mom told her she didn t want them to be together He pretty much hung up on me so I decided to give him space as he clearly didn t want to talk about it Today when I asked him if he wanted to play any games I didn t want to bug him about what happened He said he would so we got on and played for about minutes before he left to go play a different game After a few hours he called and sounded extremely intoxicated He asked to play so I hopped on the game and joined him I asked him if he was drunk he said he was I could tell This is where it gets to our conversation I asked why he was drinking so much he explained that he has felt like he was having a heart attack all day and yesterday He was slurring his speech making incoherent sentences etc Then he very casually says he wants to blow his brains out It took me by surprise and I asked him why He says he was in pain saying that he wants to end it so he no longer feels how he is anymore I got more and more concerned as he spoke I had no idea what to say I know for a fact that he has the means and intent to do something like that so I asked him if he was serious why he was going to do it He said he was serious and said he wanted to end his pain and that he didn t deserve to live anymore I tried to tell him that I care about him and that I would miss him his family and friends would etc Anything I could think of to say to him He just shot everything down saying he hates everyone and that his family and friends including me could fuck off and go to hell because he will be dead and won t have to deal with the consequences of his death I pretty much was left crying my eyes out left not knowing what to say All I could say was your life matters to me and I would be upset if you died After repeatedly saying he didn t care he finally says do you think if I was actually going to kill myself I would be sitting here talking to you No i wouldn t be He basically started to lash out against me and I had nothing left to say He had shrugged off anything I could think of to say Right now I am heading off to work and said he could call me and I would talk to him if he needed or wanted to talk He didn t respond and just logged off of the game Hasn t answered my texts or calls It s not my fault I have to go to work and can t listen to him calling me a whore for the rest of the night But I did offer to listen while I was at work I honestly have no idea what to do anymore I m not sure how serious his threats were and I have no idea where he lives no contact other than his cell phone number I don t know if I should reach out to his family members on Facebook or if that would cause more damage,"Critical Risk, Mental Distress,

Will Pedophilia Happen To Be Normalized In the Future Pedophilia is not something new we all have been sickened or rather even angered by the very existence of it However in the recent past weeks a large number of social media accounts news articles and even memes have been discussing the very topic of the so called MAPS self identified maps aka pedophiles and how they are trying to normalize themselves by trying to get along with LGBtQ communities and even going as far as creating a flag to represent themselves Personally as a person who is extremely critical to topics of pedophilia and rape I was sickened and was worried In a recent talk with one of my friends about these topics we saw how people of LGBTQ communities were oppressed and were often hated and harassed by the general public and how it can still be seen in our older generation such as our grandparents and even our peers often labeling them as unnatural I was told about how just like in the past the people who hated LGBTQ communities are now considered conservative and parochial one day we might be too be seen like this but in this case it would be due to our disagreement with the very presence of pedophiles Countless underaged children are being abused and over sexualize for the sake of entertainment and fame by their parents and guardians and it has provided with a means of media for these pedophiles and you can virtually find child porn in literally any hentai Japanese pornographic art labeled as loli available at one click away Will in the future after common interaction of people about such sensitive topics make them numb and result in pedophilia to become destigmatized and be a thing of the future and we have to stay quiet about it I as a person is genuinely scared and angered with the very possibility and the helplessness I feel Please let me know what you think tl dr Will pedophilia become common and legalized and we will be known as the boomers of the future generations,"Mental Distress, Mood Tracking","Miscellaneous, Positive Coping, Progress Update"

Pushed away the girl I loved She was the only person that made me happy Since then it s been a downhill My weight makes anything near impossible I m put down everyday I m just struggling with life Hello I m a long time lurker here and after an argument I just had with my mom I feel I need to share my story and convey my emotions It s gonna be a long one sorry Thank you to anyone who does infact take the time to read my story I m going to start by saying I m years old and have been battling depression for the past ish years I m a pretty big guy for my age st about lb I grew up independently cooking for myself and being young obviously cooking meals for myself which just weren t healthy at all in large portion sizes which have lead to me being the weight I am now I remember the days in school when I used to run m and enjoy all types of sports and now I can t do any of that at all Towards my GCSEs in school was when the depression started I had friends who would bully me make jokes about my weight thinking I was okay with it I wasn t It hurt inside I started skipping school and sleeping a lot that was my life for a good while However I started speaking to a girl in my year still not sure how that happened maybe she just felt bad for me We were just friends but spoke to each other everyday We d FaceTime each other for hours and just talk watch films together anything really This was the first girl who d actually taken the time with me and the first person I d ever really spoken to about personal things like my relationship with my dad I ended up falling in love with this girl because of how she treated me the only issue she liked my friend She d speak about him when we was on the phone together and I was jealous I could never say anything though we were just friends in her eyes As much as I loved this girl and how she listened to me I couldn t tell her how I felt and ended up pushing her away the biggest mistake of my life She was the one person in life who made me happy and I ruined that This happened a week after I finished school ready to start the next venture of my life I had the whole summer to enjoy myself but began to just stay in isolate myself and eat I did this for weeks It was coming to the end of summer and I had to apply somewhere whether that be a job an apprenticeship or college I waited until the very last minute and then joined college In all fairness college was great I met a bunch of new friends who I related to and enjoyed my time but the stress of assignments due in quickly added to my depression I finally spoke to a new friend who had faced depression in the past about how I was feeling who convinced me to speak to someone I spoke to a mental health nurse who was supposedly helping me She d speak to me over the phone for like minutes asking how I was each week and had booked me in for a session with a therapist the only thing being there was a huge wait like months to see one so she advised I d be put on anti depressants I was on mg of Citalopram for months I feel these were good for me I felt good and they were helping especially with the stress of college I was able to finish my college course with a pass and enjoyed myself over the summer it was a good time I have now started my second year at college being unable to find a job or an apprenticeship being rejected at every chance I saw this was my option for the year I decided by myself I should come off my Citalopram and did so without consulting anyone This was a bad decision Everything was fine for a week or so and then everything started coming back I feel depressed again and I m stressing out over little things My weight doesn t help either I have to catch a bus into the city where my college is which takes like minutes and then a minute walk This is fine but whatever I am wearing and whatever the weather I sweat abnormally either due to my weight or some issue that I don t know of yet It s the most embarrassing and uncomfortable thing I constantly feel like crap turning up to college or just walking around and being sweaty I could try and lose the weight but through my depression I m just not motivated even though I know I need to lose this weight The depression has gotten to the point where I m now experiencing suicidal thoughts I can t live with how unhealthy I am It kills me everyday I need a solution which is ultimately to lose weight but I just can t I honestly feel like I m going to kill myself soon either by eating myself to death or actual suicide because of this I just don t know what to do I thank you for reading my post didn t really know what to write or how to write and lay it out but however jumbled up my post is it was good to write this for my sake as someone that rarely speaks about their issues I d also like to thank everyone hear that offers their voice and helps out people that post their feelings here everyday whilst I am hear It s definitely helped me sometime looking at posts and seeing how people help each other Thank you,"Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Positive Coping, Seeking Help, Progress Update, Mood Tracking, Cause of Distress","Cause

Should I quit my job and end it all A little background I m a year old guy diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder who recently started therapy and am going to start group I work as a retail cashier and nearly every other coworker is around my age I feel like I have a pretty good albeit superficial relationship with everyone I m a mostly quiet but sometimes bubbly and energetic guy Myself and my manager who is only are pretty close especially as we discuss our anxiety with each other A few months ago I started crushing hard on a new coworker and asked her out only to find out she s already in a relationship On the outside I say it s cool and we remain friends but on the inside I m devastated I romanticized her put her on a pedal She was the one and if we started dating all my problems and low self esteem would go away Because I mean if this amazing person told me they loved me then surely I d never feel bad again So in a fit of all these feelings I jokingly told my manager I wanted to kill this girl s boyfriend I was obviously joking and my manager laughed along I even told my manager I wasn t actually thinking that and that I was just hurt So I have an intense fear of social rejection I m paranoid that everyone around me is talking behind my back making fun of me and purposely not inviting me out This stems from experiences and believes from my abuser in middle and high school Then an incident in college where I confided in a friend about my suicidality lead them to shaming me and telling the rest of our class leading to them ostracizing me So me being open with my feelings has bit me in the ass a great number of times So today I ended up working with the coworker I had a crush on and she asks me if I ve been talking behind her back That she s heard from a lot of people that I m obsessed with her and want to kill her boyfriend I am able to explain that I only told our manager as a joke and that I shouldn t have said that and she seemed to be okay with that But now I know the truth That my manager who I confided in told my secrets to everyone else and they are actually making fun of me behind my back I have caused my worst fears to come true So now I have a decision should I quit my job which I ve always hated and wanted to quit anyway or realize that I m overreacting about the situation I don t work tomorrow so I m thinking of calling in and quitting by the phone without giving any reason why I just want to make this one phone call and never think about that place ever again I m currently living with my family so I only have car payments and a few bills every month But to be honest I just want to quit my job release my album and then kill myself I don t want another job another chance at embarrassment another chance at failure another chance at ruining everything I m just so damn tired and I don t care about my life anymore Or maybe I m just overreacting I can t tell,"Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Positive Coping, Seeking Help, Progress Update, Mood Tracking, Cause of Distress","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Maladaptive Coping, Mental Distress, Mood Tracking, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

An empty chair at all the tables Reddit I don t know There are a thousand reasons to post and a thousand more to delete these words I realize that a lot of you are here to mock people like me People that complain and I realize that there are some of us who take so much for granted Who don t see what we have and dwell in the past I realize I may be one of them though I still look in the mirror and find nothing staring back My greatest moments are the mornings that I wake and can t remember who I am or why I am where I am For a small window of time I have a lot of reasons for why I think I am the way I am and they might not be an excuse I understand that But it s the only thing I can think of to get myself through the day My dad died That s all I can start it off as From junior high up to my twentieth birthday he was an alcoholic and my mother relied on prescription medication like Atavan Methadone He was the only sane parent but we cared for my ninety six year old grandmother his parents long out of state to avoid responsibility and he lost himself in the alcohol Now that I am older I don t blame him You need one way to cope and he lost the war My mother goaded him on with her bullshit She stole from me She took credit cards out under my name We moved three times a year until we finally left state From California to Texas hoping that he would fix himself I won t forget the day he died It was Five Six days to thanksgiving We had just returned from Texas left him in a trailer he bought on his retirement because my mother talked him into it I won t forget how he reeked of piss how he d lost so much weight due to some Illness or when we d drive by the trailer park every day Take him to get groceries Clothes He d always be in the driveway drunk unconscious I hated him For beating me For not being the man I knew growing up For abandoning my sister and I when we needed him the most None of his family helped us Until the day he died My grandparents found him Dead Sober for two weeks and then we fought Told him if he forced us to give him his money he would drink and we wouldn t see him again He called the night before he died Asked my sister and I to visit him Have pudding When we arrived the duct tape was up The police were guarding the trailer and they wouldn t let me see him My grandmother his mother Hugged me Said my mother better take responsibility for what had happened I was too shocked to understand They all came flooding in Family Just for the funeral after ten years of silence Ten years of not giving a shit and suddenly they don t want pissing games A week later Thanksgiving had passed They wanted to see us for the holidays Just me and my sister Just to tell us what we did wrong What they saw when they found him How they found him And to tell us word for word That we did not try hard enough They call themselves family and until now four years later It has all been the same No one is genuine I fail at every turn Twenty three No college career The only person I care about tells me I care because they re the only person that has been kind to me for years I am only a good friend I can t come back from the debt of carrying my family while my parents were unconscious for months on the couch at seventeen I can t do anything Death is not an option It never was I am afraid of the darkness The ever lasting sleep Of pain But I want it A reason to stop because I have seen what life is What true nine to five married family every day life can do to you I don t want to do it,"Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Seeking Help, Progress Update, Mood Tracking, Cause of Distress","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Maladaptive Coping, Mental Distress, Mood Tracking, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

I realised no one can look after me F I ve had mental health problems inherited and years of abuse my entire life which culminated in the current diagnoses of bipolar GAD PTSD Body Dysmorphia OCD and ADD I also already have psoriatic arthritis and fibromyalgia which used to be really bad when I was obese kg and my ex husband buried his head in the sand and ignored my health problems and I would be in bed alone for hours unable to walk and he would leave me a glass of water and some biscuits I left him and found someone who seemed the opposite M and I moved across the world for him and his kids and became a step mum and lost kg so now I m a trophy too My mental health is being managed well but in the last months I ve found I ve got cervical cancer for the second time my bowel isn t working so I need surgery and then finally in the last weeks I got leg paralysis and they ve ruled out physical causes and are leaving MS on the table on top of everything else I have an amazing job I am an international keynote speaker popular on social media etc friends all over have world but I never let any of them know how dark I m feeling I was sort of coping but adding Covid and lockdown has shown that I genuinely don t have anyone to care for me if I am diagnosed with MS My partner who was amazing picks and chooses when I m worth looking after depending on his mood I m currently stuck in bed no food trying not to drink anything because my leg paralysis means limiting walking around having a text argument where I m begging him to come talk to me but he refuses to believe it s that bad and I should walk to the living room I said to my mother that if I got MS I would move back to England and live with her and although she was jokey she made is it clear I couldn t But my partner has shown that he clearly can t keep his emotions in check and look after me He talks the talk when we are in a good place but today has shown how proud and petty he is and the detrimental impact on my physical and mental health as a result So here I am with medications wondering if anything is worth striving for anymore It s a yr track of uncertainty and relapses for MS diagnosis all whilst I m dealing with the cervical cancer and dead bowel both of which need surgery but it s been delayed for Covid I have been so close to ending my life countless times since early childhood but today just felt like a day of accidental goodbyes and clarity over the lack of control of my future I ve had my emotional tearful breakdown but now I feel calm and ready Does anyone get to that clarity How do I get back to reality because surely this can t be the end,"Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Seeking Help, Progress Update, Mood Tracking, Cause of Distress","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Maladaptive Coping, Mental Distress, Mood Tracking, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

It just seems like the right idea at the moment Hi reddit I ve lurked a while and things in my life have lately come to a fever pitch I feel trapped by everything and I don t feel like I live in a world where I m truly free anymore My relationships are burning me alive and even my friendships feel porous and deceitful I could use the kind words cause I know there are no answers I included my poetry I don t know why I guess to seem like an individual worth encouraging I can t escape the overriding feeling that everything in my life is rotting Thanks for your time I m a well traveled man with a stride and a plan to wander less near from so far But nothing I will see or ever have seen beats back the Big Bang in my yard See Williker Tidds who lived with his kids was a bootlegger hot off the south and when prohibition brought in inhibition Ol Williker whistled his mouth and said Jesus H Christ boy these people these people All looking for just a load off Now run back and forth and stay drunk on the sly While the cops they retreat from the law And though the money all goes up the expenses hose What if one could handle the weight Could one make such a still that its liquor would fill Every Sub Mason Dixon Line State Well Jehosephat Joe I know just where to go there s a rock that fell out of the sky And its shiny and hard and not an inch of its charred even though ten foot round the brush died And the sound it creates when you hit it or knock it is softer than you think it would And the air doesn t smell like there s burning in fact the scent surrounding s quite good But its steel like and feels like a distant vibration a rail for a train yet to come And its cold as a spring even though the damn thing is just cookin right there in the sun So he brought in a team and they all got the rock to sit stark on the back of his trailer And he hammered and blacksmithed and worked on great sheets of the asteroid thinner and paler And with tireless zeal and a few hurried meals Tidds fashioned a splendid machine And he stuffed it with grains and he churned up a batch that he knew would be sweet strong and clean But when the day came to cash in on his game Williker gasped cause he wasn t sure If inside of the still floating round in the mash was a light so bright and so pure that a glance would set ones imagination on fire and the soul too would in rapture burn For the colors contained in that shimmer or glimmer would take a gods mind just to learn And he swallowed and watched with a glow on his face and a helpless look right in his eyes He said Mercy what what is that and then went inside and turned off the light But at night he rest stubbornly and the thoughts in his head Ran around in insomniac roar And when he sat on the edge of the foot of his bed The light glowed outside of his door With a start he stood up and ran right to his still which emitted a casual hum and the light that shot out from the top of the tank lit the night like a placebo sun And his shout was so loud that was wife the old cow woke and waddled outside just to yell But the second she saw what dropped Willikers jaw then so too Etnas jaw promptly fell For the tank had been melting for quite a long time and the whiskey had boiled away And the brand new universe just sat there shining at the end of its very first day Theres a lot going on in universe spawn some things that you really can t know Like the sound planets make when theyre bumping and thumping as the galaxies they re inside grow And the trillion quarks making zillions of sparks as they bristle and crystal collide And the nebulas blooming and supernovas booming for young stars are too doomed to die And just hanging in air over two wide eyed stares the universe gained dimension and size And its growth was quite slow But quite steady and so in a year the Tidds moved lest they died For their house had been burned by a baby red giant like a superball coated with lava And their vase was erased by tiny black hole and some meteors got on the guavas And the living conditions grew dimmer and dimmer in the town where Williker lived And as land was devoured while men scattered and cowered People knew that something had to give For insurance adjusters had no clue what to write when the house was clearly just gone and replaced by universe golden and glowing and taking more insured houses on Then the government came with their titles and names and declared the small town a lost cause And in haste the whole state had to evacuate said the brand new ex states new state laws And for year after year the grand spectacle grew Until Tennessee was just an orb That hung twinkling high like a jewel in the sky Looking for a new state to absorb And slowly we retreat with the back of our feet hot from The Fires of Wondrous Creation But we all kinda wish that the need for the booze hadn t set up our own immolation For the commune we live in at the edge of the world while it numbers a billion strong Loses faith as the land that we have slips away and may be gone before way too long But there s hope in my heart for the world and its arts because the future is exceedingly bright For inside of the Big Bang the suns live so close that their day is no different from night And I m not really scared I m in love with my fate swallowed whole by the future constructive But maybe sometimes in the back of my mind i wish drinking was much less destructive,"Critical Risk, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Mood Tracking, Cause of Distress","Critical Risk, Maladaptive Coping, Mood

"I have been actually feeling positive most of the time lately. I thought I was all Radical Acceptance and no rage. My brother called talking his pastor who had run himself off a bridge because he was busted for hitting on women he was ""counseling"". He was, for some reason, shocked that this goes on. My dad went into the ""he's just a man"" cliche bullshit routine and started naming preachers he knew who had done bad things. He finally got to the man who sexually abused me and listed him as ""Father J, who I credit with bringing me back into the church - you know his story.""
 
 I have been walking around with pain from this man for 30 years, don't fucking praise him. Don't credit him. If you mention him, mention that he's a piece of shit.

Not meant for this worldI ve been coming to the conclusion that I was simply not made for this world I am irrationally empathetic especially with those closest to me I have a nature of literally only taking care of others and not myself and I get severely disgusted whenever I do nice things for myself Sometimes I ll go days on end of not eating or drinking simply bent on the thought of my desire to help and care for others My body can t take it anymore Shit hit the fan pretty bad for me when the virus started to break out across the US I was forced to move from the first place I had truly called home college It was my first year there away from an abusive and neglecting family that had abandoned me once before People genuinely cared for me at the college I was at and I felt a sense of well being that I had never before experienced in my life The virus ripped me out of my dorm and sent me back home to an older brother and father that are constantly on edge ready to explode The last and only thing I could put my hope in were my grandparents My grandma is the most loving and caring person I have ever met and she is easily my closest friend My grandpa always provided me the greatest advice and support One week back at home continuing the spring semester online I got news that my grandpa was hospitalized for a severe and complicated medical condition To add on my grandma s knees gave out and she too was hospitalized for a close to death heart attack I immediately went over to be with them in the hospital and I would go on to take care of them back at their home for the rest of the semester It was by far the most stressful time of my life Having to stay on top of schoolwork provide consistent care for my grandparents and manage my own health heart and mental issues was extremely difficult But I was more than willing to do anything for my grandparents because of all that they had done for me After a tragic fall and a brutal season of hospice my grandpa passed At that point I couldn t take it any more I promised myself years ago that the pain I felt after my other grandpa passed I was not going to go through it again I was going to do whatever it took to not have to bear with another loved ones death And so here I am now I was not strong enough to care for my grandpa and I failed him I failed my grandma for not being the kind of support that she needed I don t deserve the right to live because of my faults I ve just been so numb ever since he passed that I completely have no idea what to do,"Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Mood Tracking, Cause of Distress","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Maladaptive Coping, Mental Distress, Mood Tracking, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

"I have had a funny feeling lately. Kind of unusual. Its like I woke up from a nap kind of late after a long day of work.When I awoke it was already dark, and suddenly my dark apartment felt extremely dark. And the Normal solitude I am accustomed to became so intolerable. It almost felt like a panic attack in a way.Yet my heart was not racing. Yet I felt on edge, and so so very alone.I busied myself with some quick chores. Suddenly a friend of mine messaged and I messaged them back quickly. They even called and its like I was so thrilled to talk with them for awhile and the feeling began to fade.I just do not understand it well.I have lived alone for several years nowand I am accustomed to it even prefer it at times.And yet waking up suddenly this evening the feeling of being alone felt like a prison. Completely intolerable.I was curious if anyone has ever felt anything like that.

"I was talking to my bf about (funnily enough) BPD traits that I’d learned the explanations of on Tiktok. I was giving an example of one (about tying yourself too much to your actions, so that when someone asks you to do something, like, “Do you mind putting your cup somewhere else next time?,” you get oddly angry and defensive because it feels like they attacked you personally), and I gave an example of my own. I guess it was too pointed with the tone I used, because my bf accused me of having a specific time in mind that involved him, and became on edge and told me I was getting triggered and needed to take medicine. No matter how many times I told him that I didn’t have a specific instance in mind and that I didn’t mean to sound so pointed, I don’t think he believed me. He just wanted me to hurry up and go have some space so I wouldn’t freak out. 
 
 And it’s like WHY does it have to be that I’m attacking him when I am not?? I’ve had a lot of trouble with it before, and can still struggle now, but I’m trying to be BETTER. Even when I notice I’m getting triggered, I’ll sometimes try to diffuse my emotions/distract myself by showing my bf a funny video I found on tiktok. And does it matter? Of course not! All that matters was that I got triggered in the first place, and that’s a point against me. 
 
 Why does it feel like people WANT me to be the fucking problem sometimes? I swear, I’m trying to get better, but it doesn’t matter to anyone! They’re used to me having a problematic role, and that’s just where I’m supposed to stay. 
 
 If I get triggered, I’m a toxic lunatic. If I tell people that I was able to cope better and not freak out this time, it’s a little “good job,” and then forgetting it ever happened. And that happens with EVERYTHING, not just my BPD. 
 
 I’m largely seen as lazy and irresponsible, and it’s TRUE. I’m a waste of space! But, when I finally accomplish a tiny step forward, it’s fine, but not a big deal, because I should’ve been doing that already.
 
 Why do ANYTHING, then?? Myself and the people around me have gotten too used to how awful I am. We’re all too comfortable. But, I really wanna feel/do better and FEEL SEEN.","Cause of Distress, Mood Tracking, Mental Distress, Progress Update","Miscellaneous, Positive Coping"

My mum took my fucking drawing pad all because she seems to forget that I m quite literally diagnosed with depression She took my phone and drawing pad last night because I m behind on assignments understandable Pissed me off but I get it but decided today that she ll waltz into my room give me back my phone after I proved to her that I did the fucking work but not my drawing pad Now there s several fucks I don t give about my phone I have a computer a switch and a DS I have millions of other forms of entertainment But she s taken my drawing pad the one thing I find even remotely enjoyable at this point since upcoming exams are just fucking me in the ass I was trying to get some sleep since I stayed up late doing the or assignments I needed to do of them being maths past test papers which isn t my best subject online maths homework and a biology revision pack and she came into my room woke me up and basically said that I need to shake off my sluggish mood That I shouldn t be laying around all the time Now I get where she s coming from I wouldn t be as royally upset as I am if I were some lazy teenager who just didn t want to do anything and was a bum But for some wacky wild reason she seems to forget that she quite literally pays a therapist to help deal with the clinical depression SHE KNOWS I have It s like do you just think it s having a low self esteem And hating myself The reason I m asleep all the time is because I m fucking tired all the time I can t even begin to muster up the motivation to do the work most times All I had at that point was the fact that I like drawing in my down time You don t have to think of the bad shit when drawing but she s fucking taken it and I don t know what to do It doesn t help that the past few weeks it s been really really bad To the point where I ve been thinking of not so nice things everyday and she s just gone and made it worse Literally just made it seem like it was a mind over matter God I m just so mad And upset This is just a flaming hot pile of shit piss and garbage,"Mental Distress, Seeking Help, Progress Update, Mood Tracking, Cause of Distress","Cause of Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Mental Distress, Mood Tracking, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

To the one quietly contemplating what he would miss I was like you once I had no vision of any overseable future I was blind to life and what it presented me with I was depressed and apathic nihilisticly searching for a way out I went through the motions every day I forced myself out of bed in the morning Usually i overslept with a few hours but luckily very few people could step into my shoes at work so it was tolerated I went to work and collapsed on the bed when i got home I saw no point in the totality of my neverchanging excistence and i wanted to die I wanted cancer i wanted it to end And at the strangest times your wish is often granted A day at the doctor reveiled an abnormality in a lymphenode I was admitted to the cancer treatment hospital for an operation and released a few days later Nothing to write home about really but my belief in a pointless existence had been rocked as i started to realize id be dead at the age of if this was a hundred maybe even years ago Contemplating these things i started with time to realize id actually miss the small things in life if i died I would never have felt the sun on my face again the wind pulling at my clothes The snowstorms chilling my bones and stabbing my cheeks I would never again have eaten a pancake with shugar Never smelt the clean air after a thunderstorm Id never again see a lovely girl walking in a bikini at the beach Never again hear the birds chitter over the mountain stream quietly dancing through the meadows And so these thoughts started to condense and i came to the conclusion that the things i would miss were not specific to say the pancake I would miss the very basic action The seeing hearing feeling tasting and smelling I would miss my senses And thus i knew why i was alive I knew the essence of my existence With this epiphany a new kind of sense came into being a combination of them all It can be described as nothing else than The experience I could suddenly stop when it came over me and just be Just feel the experience of receiving input through the senses It was exhilarating Sitting on a bench in a town square Riding a roller coaster walking in the woods All the things that would challenge my senses and push them further than before And my wish for death slowly started to melt away But wishes granted are often granted with a two barreled shotgun to use a different cliche than the double edged sword one The cancer of course was back and got a real grip this time I was granted my wish and i could never take it back I was admitted again the same day it was discovered and scheduled for a hour open surgery the next day After not eating for a day and drinking lots of foul tasting bowel emptying juices the surgeon came to see me to explain what he was going to do They were going to go inn through my stomach muscles up under the rib cage and remove of the worst affected lymphnodes in my thorax I was given a pill to daze me for insertion of some kind of coma inducing dripper into my spine I believe coma is preferred during these operations over drugs that shut down your nerves I dont even remember counting backwards before the void claimed me for the first time And then my world exploded I was wide open from my pelvis to my ribcage I was mangled and the pain was like a perfect storm The one that lifts you off your feet and slams you into the wall The one that rips trees from the ground and grinds your very soul to cinders I was dying and it couldnt come fast enough Two hands appeared at my side They were female and very pretty The nails were cut short and had no nailpolish They were covered in a brownish residue The skin was smooth but the folds around the joints were prominient It was the hands of a year old woman It never occurred to me to look up All that existed through the storm where those hands and the needle they were injecting into a plastic tube hanging next to my head And so i vanished into the darkness and hoped i would not remember this where i was going next I was floating in nothing and there was something familiar with the interruptions in my existence Sounds it had been called Voices dawned on me and i knew that was it Far away voices were talking A male and a female It was crude and gutteral Ugly cracks in silence I shut them out and the void reclaimed me to take me to my next existence There is something strangling me I realized waking up I wanted to tell the voices but i couldnt speak I wanted to wave to get their attention but i couldnt move I had no influence on this world I was a rock drowning in a river I was alone A constant high pitched tone started up in the distance The current swept me away and the void reclaimed me to take me to my next existence This one will be better i thought and decided try life again Are you ok Someone asked me I was in the recovery ward and the storm had abated I still couldnt move but i was able to open my eyes This is progress i remember thinking I am luckier than the last time i lived After recovering from the operation i was placed on a chemo therapy that lasted for months At the start i thought nothing much of it but i soon deteriorated into a quivering shadow of what i once was I was hooked up to the rat poison every weekday but the Thursdays were the worst Two nurses and a doctor usually came visiting with a bag wrapped in aluminium foil carried on a tray They were all wearing gloves and masks Thursdays i wanted to live more than any other day of the week I used to love the nights back then I do to this day actually They were free of the poison and it was bliss All the tubes and wires were disconnected and i felt like pinochio turning into a real boy If i was drugged enough i could almost remember being alive I could almost remember that i once could walk for a mile That i could laugh and run jump and climb a tree Almost alive somewhere There was a room on the ninth floor with some couches chairs and a tv where four patients used to sit and not talk The tv was never on They would stare at me and nod when i entered but never say anything I dont think they even knew each others names But they seemed as close as any friends could ever get I enjoyed their company even though they were years older than me Age didnt seem to matter we were all here and there was nothing to say I started to frequent this room more and more as time passed Everywhere else there were people wanting to talk or look encourage or pity It was disgusting and I hated them all About weeks had passed and a blessed night came again I quietly walked through the corridors until a man came up to me It was the first male nurse i had seen since i was admitted I hadnt thought of it before but this work place was really dominated by women He had made me cereal with milk one of the few things i could swallow without puking back up There is plenty of shugar he said smiling as he handed me the bowl Not waiting for a thank you he turned and left He d seen the night walkers before and knew what was coming The bowl was heavy and i knew i couldnt carry it far so i headed for the stairs leading up to the th floor At the first step i knew i wouldnt be able to climb them this night I had always liked sitting in stairs for some reason and found a sort of poetic beauty in having this meal here The stone was cold and i sat down with the bowl in my lap I had to spent a few moments getting my breath back Being able to bend down to sit is something you might not cherish But once you loose it you realize its immense value Dark empty halls seemed to stretch for an eternity Nothing outside mattered or was even real anymore These halls were the world i knew now the foundation of my existence I started eating my cereals letting go of one piece of my past for each bite Grinding the memories as i chewed Chomp i was climbing in a tree I could see to the end of the world i could climb into the sky Chomp i was on a swing with Eve We were weightless we were flying She was laughing and i shared in her laughter Chomp i was riding a bike I was going faster than i had ever thought possible No runner could ever catch up with me Chomp I was walking to school I was curious of what would come Excited of what we would learn Chomp I was landing my first heelflip on a skateboard I was proud i was admired by others i was accepted Chomp I was riding a moped I could go wherever i wanted i was free Chomp I was running through the woods with an ag automatic rifle I was in a brotherhood I was defending a nation Chomp I was at a party talking to Kristin I was in love Tears started streaming down my face as she vanished but there was no going back and i continued eating Chomp I was on extacy at a rave The beats vibrated through the air that surrounded me I was a spiral galaxy i was dancing flame Chomp I was being told i had cancer I was speechless Chomp i was walking into a small room of people with strange eyes on the ninth floor I was missing something important Chomp I was handed a bowl of cereals from a smiling man I was grateful Chomp i was siting down on stone steps I was sitting Chomp i was eating cereal I was eating Chomp i am chewing I am the sum of my experiences and memories I am old My whole life had vanished as i finished my last meal A calm feeling of being whole came over me and i was ready I sat the bowl down closed my eyes and then i died You cant sleep here the male nurse told me Your immune system is nonexistent and these steps are cold Lets get you back to bed And that is how my next existence started I was hollow for a long time after that It was like sensing through a veil Like listening to voices from under water Everything was far away and i was looking at reality from outside Time passed and i went again to the room on the ninth floor There were three now They nodded as i entered but seemed to look at me differently recognizing something And suddenly i saw what they had always said as it echoed in my mind We who are about to die salute you And they were right We were gladiators we were fighters and we had all been sentenced to die But each moment we had was a treasure more precious than any earthly riches We had nothing we could loose nothing we could want nothing that could ever be taken away from us Our life our thoughts our actions and opinions were no ones but our own By letting go of everything we had gained something new A new beginning where each experience is a separate existence Like an eternal supply of white paper and colored pencils We had gained life And so i write this post not only to free myself from previous battles and to wake again to a new existence But to tell you that in your next existence you will one day wake up and realize it is all better that today is a good day I promise,"Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Positive Coping, Seeking Help, Progress Update, Mood Tracking, Cause of

What do I do now Had an appointment with my care coordinator today what I assume to be my last appointment after being told despite what the medical evidence supports that he felt that I would get better and am not in need of the service my progression has been slow to naught with even a handwritten note from my last therapy session stating that I do not have the tools to cope with the result of said therapy lowering my depression score by points and increasing my anxiety by My care coordinator arranged a psychiatrist to prescribe me lamotigrine lamictal but i have yet to even touch near my therapeutic dose I haven t been made aware of a plan in an increase of dose and now have been cut off from any known plan All I know is that i ll be placed under the care of a new lesser controlled team to whom I will have to re refer to every time I finish my sessions of therapy I feel that I am not sick enough or not in crisis enough to be worth their time that despite being told to read a self help book my carer did not bother to do the same to research the repercussions of creating an experience in which i feel abandoned and invalidated Ignoring every time I say I m getting worse denying me my right to a written diagnosis while still treating me under a working diagnosis Giving me medication that will kill me and then throwing me off to the curb like it s not a risk I won t save them up to overdose and then creating me a reason to do so What am I supposed to do act on these painful emotions to gain my right to treatment what s the point I d have to repeatedly do so to stay within the system wouldn t be easier to just kill myself not that it s an easy thing to do but it s easier then trying to hurt yourself enough to get treatment and when I think about it in that sense then I really do fit the borderline PD that society hates me for it s bad enough I ve be idealization self mutilation and suicide but now it s becoming the only options as a call for help or an end to the suffering,"Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Seeking Help, Progress Update, Mood Tracking, Cause of Distress","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Mood Tracking, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

My girlfriend told my family about my suicidal thoughtsSo recently I ve been having more suicide thoughts so much so that I ve been thinking about doing it times this week Everytime I have these thoughts I tell my girlfriend about it and she usually calms me down and talks to me about it But today i was at my girlfriend s house and she got mad at me about something I did that made us not able to go on this huge date that we ve been planning She got really mad at me and started yelling at me which she had never done before I of course get super insecure about this and my suicidal thoughts kick in because of the kinds of things she s saying I start crying and she sees and immediately stops comes by my side and starts apologizing profusely for the things she said My suicidal thoughts were probably the worst they ve ever at then and i just couldn t control myself I was just curled up on her couch crying replaying the things she said in my mind over and over again Meanwhile she s trying to get the thoughts to leave my head by talking to me and trying to calm me down but its not working Then after about minutes I tell her im actually wanting to kill myself like I was going to do it later that day She starts crying and sends a text to my mom to come over to her house asap My mom comes and my gf tells her about my suicidal thoughts My mom talks to me about it and asks my gf to come over to my house so she can talk with the whole family about it She comes and she sits down with my parents and brother about whats going on with me They react very caringly and tell me they are here for me and that if I need to see a therapist I can This was the first time I ever talk to my family about this and I was super scared of doing it I was afraid they would judge me get mad at me or something but they were really helpfully and showed they cared about it Hopefully seeing a therapist would help my depression and suicidal tendencies Edit Thank you guys for the responses I m honestly a bit scared for the future but if I get better at the end of all this then it will be worth it,"Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Seeking Help, Progress Update, Mood Tracking, Cause of Distress","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Maladaptive Coping, Mental Distress, Mood Tracking, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

Breathing is painful for me Every breath hurts chronic pain makes it hard to keep goingI meant that it literally hurts for me to breathe not that it hurts to exist In I had a turbinate reduction Turbinates are bony structures in the nose that warm and humidify the air you breathe Because the procedure was botched my turbinates no longer do their job The air I breathe is cold and harsh I get constant headaches my throat is always dry because the air I breathe is dry and my nose is too open so the air pounds the back of my throat when I inhale As a result I have trouble sleeping hence why I am posting this at almost AM I feel a drowning sensation if I sniff too hard I have moments where my nostrils just burn They call this Empty Nose Syndrome a condition many doctors won t acknowledge They literally think it doesn t exist I exhibit all of the symptoms that come with this disease except for the defining symptom which is feeling like you re suffocating I m thankful I don t feel the worst symptom but also feel like if I did I would have killed myself long ago and maybe that would have been a good thing because it would mean my suffering would not have gone on for years but because I don t feel that symptom I m hesitant to call it that It s easy to tell someone things will get better because a lot of the time they do But sometimes I m not so sure you can tell that to someone suffering from chronic physical pain especially from something which is rare and has no cure My turbinates will never grow back My only hope is that there will be advances in regenerative medicine in my lifetime that are amazing enough to restore missing nasal tissue I don t see that happening especially when the focus is on helping people with much more common conditions I m invisible to the medical community I haven t been happy since my breathing was ruined I hate that breathing hurts because it s literally the one thing people have to do all the time It s hard to focus on things because the pain is so distracting I m going to wrap up my second bachelor s degree a degree in Computer Science in the fall and it kind of sucks knowing it would have been so much easier if breathing just felt normal again Same applies to all the things I like doing I enjoy everything less because I have to breathe while doing it obviously Playing games making music spending time with my loved ones all of it I enjoy life less because of it to the point where I m not sure it s worth living anymore I d go into six figures of medical debt today if I knew I could get my turbinates back I d trade this for cancer in a heartbeat at least you can beat cancer and at least it kills you if you lose the battle instead of making you suffer until you die I d go back in time years if it meant I could change the decision to walk into the operating room I d rather deal with the congestion I used to have any day of the week I hate feeling like a prisoner in my own body and I feel like killing it means I win Not a day goes by that I don t think about killing myself I m certainly not going to do it this week or this month Maybe after I achieve a lot of the things I wanted to achieve because there are still things I want to do before I die But if I am ever in a mall and a mass shooting takes place I promise you that I ll be the first person charging at the shooter Best case scenario I m a hero and saved a ton of people Worst case scenario I m a victim and nobody has to feel guilty for my killing myself That s my rant I m going to try to fall asleep again If anyone took the time to read all of this thank you and you re free to message me or comment,"Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Seeking Help, Progress Update, Mood Tracking, Cause of Distress","Critical Risk, Mood Tracking, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

Coyote in a bear trapIn September I attempted to jump a foot bridge after driving six hours to reach a bridge high enough to kill me upon impact over water I wanted to die of internal injuries less of a clean up My partner at the time cheated on me while I was in the hospital recovering and then lied to me even though he was publicly chatting with the person in question and had them plastered on all their social media I hate my state I hate the room I m in I have no room at all They put me on lithium and klonopin and the only thing it did was curb my impulse to commit suicide sleep hours a day and turn my piss orange despite all the water I was drinking I finally started taking testosterone after waiting almost five years instead having to watch my greedy motherfucker of a father die of stage cancer lest I hurt the dead s feelings After a few weeks on testosterone I had a scare in which they gave me the wrong needles retracting ones and I went to the ER with the thought I had a needle lodged into my leg On top of out of state medical bills I also have instate ones and now ones coming in for a needle that was never fucking there My insurance spiked its rates another as a big fuck you happy new year to me Luckily since I left my job after telling my boss I was suicidal and losing hours of paid time off I am now on medicaid whatever it is for young people My therapist and my psychologist don t take it though so I ve stopped taking my medications Mostly because all I fucking do is sleep It smells like absolute shit every time I leave my house and have to travel from point A to B in this god forsaken area the jobs are pathetic with pathetic pay and wouldn t give me any meaning to life except another step closer to a heart attack I feel enormously excluded from my friends ever since my transition started to show more I m not invited out anymore nobody talks to me and everyone says to just reach out but when I do I focus on them and say I m all good I would drug myself heavier and drive back out but my piece of shit car couldn t make it having been in and out of the shop more than four times in less than two months once I was out of the hospital and doing ubereats for shit pay I m filled with hate and despite all the shit I ve overcome from childhood neglect and abuse to watching my father die and not feeling shit or dropping a single tear while I watched or at his wake stalking ex s finally starting my transition I just no longer feel like it s worth it anymore I m taking up oxygen and only making the weight of the world worse Nobody wants me around except for the money I inherited I want to end it but I can t work up the guts to do it I wish there was a simpler method If I went for it again I financially and emotionally could not risk failure I want to become nothing and cease to exist I m tired of this plane I m tired of getting punched in the fucking face every time I try to open a door I m tired of being the outsider the white elephant in the room just because I m trying to be happy All it s doing is making everyone around me feel terrible and walk away despite my attempts to just be happy and encourage them because I m fucking sick of being alone I m alone now and I ve always been alone I don t foresee it changing I just need to get it off my chest because no one else will listen or rather I won t let them listen I don t want to worry them but at the same time I m trying to scream out for someone to come and help me I ve sacrificed so much for others and I ve gotten shit in return So as a coyote stuck in a bear trap do I wait for the hunter to come and kill me get attacked in some new buttfuck way by someone I decide to trust because I m so lonely or do I chew my leg off and bleed to death on my own terms I have no purpose I see no purpose Except for going to school just to probably fail like my father said I would or end up in debt up to where the noose is I hate this world There s wonderful people in it I believe a lot of people are inherently good but I m just a cancer clinging onto it,"Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Positive Coping, Seeking Help, Progress Update, Mood Tracking, Cause of Distress","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Maladaptive Coping, Mental Distress, Mood Tracking, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

Guys this is important Cock and ball torture From Wikipedia the free encyclopedia at en wikipedia org https en wikipedia org Cock and ball torture CBT is a sexual activity involving application of pain or constriction to the male genitals This may involve directly painful activities such as genital piercing wax play genital spanking squeezing ball busting genital flogging urethral play tickle torture erotic electrostimulation or even kicking The recipient of such activities may receive direct physical pleasure via masochism or knowledge that the play is pleasing to a sadistic dominant Image Electrostimulation applied on a penis Contents Section In Pornography Section Ball stretcher Section Parachute Section Humbler Section Testicle cuff Section In pornography In addition to it s occasional role in BDSM pornography Tamakeri literally Ball kicking is a separate genre in Japan One notable actress in tamakeri is Erika Nagai who typically uses her martial arts skills to knee or kick men in the testicles Section Ball stretcher A ball stretcher is a sex toy that is fastened around a man in order to elongate the scrotum and provide a feeling of weight pulling the testicles away from the body While leather stretchers are most common other models are made of steel rings that are fastened with screws causing additional mildly uncomfortable weight to the wearer The length of the stretcher may vary from inches and the steel models can weigh as much as five pounds Section Parachute A Parachute is a small collar usually made from leather which fastens around the scrotum and from which weights can be hung Conical in shape three or four short chains hanging beneath to which weights can be attached Used as part of cock and ball torture within a BDSM relationship the parachute provides a constant drag and squeezing effects on the man s testicles Moderate weights of kg can be suspended especially during bondage Smaller weights can be used when the man is free to move when the swinging effect of the weight can restrict sudden movements as well as providing a visual stimulus for the dominant partner Section Humbler A humbler is a BDSM physical restraint device used to restrict the movement of a submissive male participant in a BDSM scene The humbler consists of a testicle cuff device which clamps around the base of the scrotum mounted in the center of a bar that passes behind the thighs at the base of the buttocks This forces the wearer to keep his legs forward as any attempt to to straighten the legs slightly pulls directly on the scrotum causing from considerable discomfort to extreme pain Section Testicle cuff A testicle cuff is a ring shaped device around the scrotum between the body and the testicles which when closed does not allow the testicles to slide through it A common type has two connected cuffs one around the scrotum and the other around the base of the penis They are just one of many devices to restrain the male genitalia A standard padlock may also be locked around the scrotum without the key it cannot be removed Some passive men enjoy the feeling of being owned while dominant individuals enjoy the sense of owning their partners Requiring such a man wear testicle cuffs symbolizes that his sexual organs belong to his partner who may be either male or female There is a level of humiliation involved by which they find sexual arousal The cuffs may even form part of a sexual fetish of the wearer or his partner However these are extreme uses of testicle cuffs More conventionally the device pulls down the testicles and keeps them there during stimulation which has a number of benefits Making the penis appear longer Pulling the testicles down and away from the base of the penis stretches the skin over the base of the penis and pubic bone exposing the additional inch or so of penile shaft that is normally hidden from view Improving sexual arousal While some men may be aroused by the feeling of being owned the physical feeling of stretching the ligaments that suspend the testicles has an effect similar to the more common practice of stretching one s legs and pointing the toes Preventing the testicles from lifting up so far that they become lodged under the skin immediately adjacent to the base of the penis a condition which can be very uncomfortable especially if the testicle is then squashed by the slap of skin during thrusting in sexual intercourse Delaying or intensifying ejaculation by preventing the testicles from rising normally to the point of no return It is much harder to reach an orgasm,"Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Seeking Help, Progress Update, Mood Tracking, Cause of Distress","Miscellaneous, Positive Coping"

At what point is it better to die than to live this way I ve been struggling with this condition for months now with no sign of recovery of my waking life my mind is blank completely devoid of mental activity It is a constant struggle of mine to maintain any form of awareness Additionally my short term and long term memory function at nearly amnesiac levels and my ability to focus and simply put think are at an atrociously low level My brain has a complete absence of mental activity This subjective experience is hard for me to quantify or explain but almost all the time my mind is completely blank like a zombie In a sense I m mentally catatonic like someone gave a computer the wattage of a light bulb just enough energy to give the appearance of awareness Every moment I m awake is a struggle to maintain some form of consciousness When not stimulated by loud music video games or the constant novelty of the Internet I zone out My mind is completely empty there is no thought whatsoever This brings me to my memory issues both short and long term trying to remember what I did as recently as yesterday requires a huge amount of effort Sometimes I ll be able to remember scattered details about the day before like where I had lunch but memories are scattered and non linear Trying to remember something that happened a day ago a week ago or a year ago feels the same There is just no clarity of memory I feel perpetually spaced out my mind feels foggy as though I m in a dream or under the influence of some substance I feel awake yet not awake sleepy although im physically fully awake I have trouble with social interaction because I just don t know what to say most of the time Frequently i have to stop and think of a decent response just to look normal because otherwise there d be nothing I have to say The times I do have something to speak up on I often stutter because I have trouble finding the right words to use or put them together in a sentence There are times where I ll just mentally blank out mid utterance and have not a clue what I wanted to say next I feel like I m just existing in this one moment with no past no connection to the present and no future I d rather die than live the rest of my life as this empty shell of a person,"Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Seeking Help, Progress Update, Mood Tracking","Critical Risk, Miscellaneous, Positive Coping, Progress Update"

Really need someone to talk to I ve had social anxiety ever since I decided to go to a different school than all the people I grew up with during the transition from elementary school to high school During the early years in my life up to grade I wasn t socially anxious at all in fact I was always the one to make people laugh and put on a show didn t mind the spotlight The only problem was these people I never really felt like I fit in with the people I grew up with I d get invited out occasionally but I never really fit it so I decided to start over by going to a different high school This would be the worst decision of my life During my two years there I was paralyzed with anxiety made one friend and began to get depressed While everyone was out enjoying life and hanging out with friends I was glued to the computer getting lost in video games as an escape from reality I would play every second I had and I feel that s what lead me to develop an anxiety disorder Oddly enough I still had no problem going to and from class or walking alone in public or anything of that nature That was years ago I m now and have been through a lot since then After being diagnosed back in I was on various drugs most of them didn t work except for one cipralex For one whole year cipralex had effectively convinced me that my socially anxious days were over I could finally be that person I d always wanted to I always knew that I had that person in me but the anxiety was preventing me from being that person After a year of feeling on top of the world the medication started to lose it s effect and I slowly spiraled downward I was pretty bummed at this point I started reading up on social anxiety on the internet I wanted to know how it worked once I knew that I could surely put an end to it over time This is when I learned about cognitive behavioral therapy I originally got a book by David D Burns to overcome my anxiety but quit half way through I ended up living with the fact that I was anxious for a few years but back in December of I came across an audio series on overcoming social anxiety The series required you to listed to a tape each week and read over the handouts for that session every day And I was faithful I d read way past the recommended minutes a day often To be perfectly honest I now know more about SA than I have in my life and I m currently still on the program a little over half way through and being faithful I ve put many of the strategies and methods learned into every day life and have had some success I ve been able to calm myself down at times and focus more externally by rationalizing my irrational thinking and taking them into a situation that would normally make me anxious At this point you re probably thinking that I posted this in the wrong section and that it sounds like things are looking up Well they are and they aren t Getting over an anxiety disorder will cause relapses so I could have my anxiety under control for a few days and then a few days after feel like a wreck I m supposed to be looking at relapses as a positive thing because you can t have a relapse if you haven t made progress And I admit I have Here s the issue Although I have this whole whack of knowledge now and have seen in work first hand this requires a lot of work mentally See before I knew any of this I d just let the negative thinking flow freely but now anytime that occurs there are steps and things I need to do to escape for the vicious circle of anxiety On top of that there are things I m having trouble with now Getting out of the house can be a nightmare at times driving is nerve wracking at times Anytime I m stopped next to someone at a red light I tense up and freeze because I feel they are looking at me Even though I know that feelings can be false because they are created by thoughts and my thoughts are irrational Getting a job is another obstacle I ve yet to overcome I graduated from college months ago and have been unemployed since and to be honest as of late I ve been pretty much cooped up in my house with the occasional outing on weekends to a bar or lounge Every day when I wake up I know I have to prepare myself for another mental struggle with myself and it s tiring My friends don t usually contact me unless I initiate first And recently a friend who I ve known since I was has been really distant for some reason Bottom line is is it worth it I m no job can t even go to the store without having a battle with my own mind I just don t know what to do My family knows I have Anxiety but not specially Social Anxiety They don t understand that these simple things like going to the store or applying for a job are very challenging for me They chalk it up to me being lazy and unmotivated when in actuality if I had rid myself of this I would have be the polar opposite I want a future I don t want to be a deadbeat But at the same time there s only so long I can continue to get rid of my SA before I become tired I m starting to learn toward the it s not worth it side Can anyone give me some advice any advice If you read my entire post I really appreciate it TLDR Had a rough time in highschool no friends eventually diagnosed with social anxiety many years later tried medication that worked but eventually stopped Been doing cognitive therapy for the past months seems to be working but recently questioning whether or not it s even worth it anymore,"Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Positive Coping, Seeking Help, Progress Update, Mood Tracking, Cause of Distress","Cause of

I live in a country with strict covid restrictions and we are strongly encouraged to stay home. Dining in has been restricted and I have little excuses to go out besides saying I am going to a friend's house. My friends have been gracious enough to invite me over anytime I need to but my mother would make a lot of negative comments about me leaving the house in this pandemic and it just discourages me to do things/tell her that I want to go somewhere/ do something. I have been receiving negative reinforcements (snide remarks, talking behind your back, breathing down your neck parenting etc) since young and this has affected me a lot as a person and I have been trying to be a better person each day. I met a guy who loved me despite everything and tried to make me a better person too; he was my shelter and escape everytime my mum hits me with the negative shit. But recently he abandoned me and left me to fend for myself and he took the light away with him too. Today I signed up for a credit card and was nagged to no end by my mother, and was called stupid over something that I did my research for. And it hit me that things have always been like this since I was young. Everything I do is not right and everything I do is dumb and everything I do has to be controlled by her. And I am so drained.

I am thinking the streets might not be so bad because at least then I wln't have to pay bills. And I might have the comradery of other people who are as sick as me. I cannot exist among normals. I used to have goals and dreams and shit but I realized I do not give two fucks what happens to me in this life. I guess a better person would carpe diem and all that but I am a bad person. I do not exist anymore. I am just depression",Mental Distress,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Maladaptive Coping, Mental Distress, Mood Tracking, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

the allegedly smart branch of our oh so glamorous military I have a house to myself I m stationed in Europe I have money almost k in the market a car paid off in April a motorcycle a cat who is a huge dick and pees on all my fucking cloths Pretty sure she is really a daemon of some sort and being a government employee I don t do a fuckin thing and it s pretty hard for me to be fired No I have never seen combat I m a cyberspace operator fucking stupid which is what the AF calls sysadmin for servers fucking year old laptops running winserv what a joke I digress I imagine a significant amount of people would kill to have what I have And here I am on a Saturday night drinking bourbon and wondering when the time comes to blow my brains out if I should do it outside so there s less of a mess I ve been in almost years now and I m on my second assignment A dream assignment My first base was in flyovercountry USA Good people and great place to raise kids but shitty and boring for young people But at least there I had people I could turn to people who would fight for us people who knew more than me I thought coming to Europe would be a major upgrade I couldn t have been more wrong My office is filled mostly with FNGs Our only NCO is a fuckwit I like Sgt Fuckwit as a person but he she is a terrible manager Does what he she is told even if it s unreasonable and would NEVER fight for their troops Doesn t know a MOTHER FUCKING THING about computers And this person is in charge What s that saying about never being the smartest person in the room Yeah I m the only mother fucker who can set up our equipment But most days we all just surf reddit and imgur I do about minutes of acutal work a week And by work I mean pointless military bullshit like SAPR training and how I need to not rape people Anyway I ve been in therapy for over half a year now for major depressive disorder social anxiety and being a threat to myself Also have OCD Schizoid traits I was hospitalized last year for a week because I was seriously ready to kill myself My doctors are pretty cool I have a good rapport with my shrink But since I couldn t be fixed to an acceptable level within the time allotted I am being medically discharged Short of serving and getting retired it s the best way to leave I ll get something like of my base pay for as long as I m fucked in the head Still want to kill myself I picture myself living in a shitty apartment no job bored miserable drunk etc I was also diagnosed with alcohol abuse disorder I was told not to drink for months at which point I could return to responsible alcohol use afterwards I complied mostly to prove them wrong but also to see how I would feel sober As you can imagine it was terrible not being able to drink especially when everybody else is The cocksuckers lied to me though told me that I was still too much at risk after the and that mixing antidepressants and alchol is a no no Like I give a shit I tried their ways I stayed sober did the CBT kept a fucking diary and so on The best advice they offer is find a purpose and distract yourself Still fucked up Still want to die Oh and because I VOLUNTARILY seeked treatment I was referd read forced for alcohol abuse treatment Because I was was in that I am automatically getting marked down on my annual performance report In the grand scope of things it doesn t mean shit but GOD DAMN what a fucking kick int he balls I save the fucking day countless times setting up that fucking eqiuptment but nobody gives a shit I m mintues late to work and all hell breaks loose I get written the fuck up some shit that says damaged the unit s mission capapblities http i imgur com lMNMAf jpg mintues late to surfing the internet at my desk Whole fucking squadron stops land the

week Met her she seemed nervous I thought things were going well It was like she changed her mind in the course of a mintue or something Tried texting her but she s done I always feel so fucking stupid afterwards ya know Like embarressed with myself for even entertaining the thougth that this time will be different Then tonight I find out that my friend who barely tries and doesn t even give a shit either way got fucked some girl last night I know I can t compare myself to him apples and organges But holy fuck did that shit sting A kind of envy that pierces my fucking soul like a red hot fireplace poker And ya know it s not so much that I m alone It s that I can t overcome the human nature of needing someone It isn t even about sex it s about that Caritas the non judemental love the feeling of mattering to someone Shit maybe I wasn t held enough as a baby or something I just think to myself okay fine I don t get to have anyone That s shitty but fine I ll accept that Can I at least be content alone No I need to feel lonely and miserable huh No matter what I read and where I search I won t find any answers and I can t make the pain any less huh That s fucked up When I do kill myself I ll do my best to explain it wasn t being an unwanted social retard that killed me it was not being able to just fucking let it go I m unwanted Fine Life goes on right No I feel this pain

Sensorimotor OCD and suicideSince August of last year I ve been obsessed with the physical sensation of breathing This initially came from an immense cannabis triggered anxiety attack which then latched onto how short of breath I felt in those days Like any other affliction it seems to fluctuate from being tolerable most days to being something that makes me have multiple panic attacks on a daily basis Hyperventilation and this naturally go hand in hand since because I m unwillingly focused on every breath I take I end up getting more oxygen in than my body really needs My life doesn t have a lot going for it right now even though compared to last year I m probably over the moon I have a job after being unemployed for more than a year even though I hate work with a passion regardless of whatever job it is and am in the first romantic relationship I ve ever been in in my life Regardless of all of these positives this breathing obsession ebbs and flows to the point where the past three quarters of a year have felt like a long winded dark night of the soul If things get worse again I feel as though I want to fade to black for good I ll miss my partner I love him to pieces I ll miss the few friends that call once in a blue moon but I just don t know if I can live with this anymore I ve tried half a dozen antidepressants I ve tried eating better I ve tried exercising I ve gone to therapy and practiced CBT and nothing s worked I don t know what to do anymore I don t want to hurt my partner but I don t know how much longer I can go on living like this It s alienating it s hard as hell to talk to anyone at all about this because I know nobody who s ever dealt with this It s maddening I feel my sanity on the verge of snapping I can t deal with it anymore,"Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Seeking Help, Progress Update, Mood Tracking, Cause of Distress","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Mood Tracking, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

I went out for my final walk the other nightFirst of all apologies for the extremely lengthy post I m years old not that it should matter mental health is an issue at any age I have no friends to confide in and my family is broken and the ones that listen don t offer great advice years ago I tried to take my own life by jumping off a bridge I fell about ft hit water and was instantly knocked unconscious I woke up in hospital the next morning surrounded by doctors and my girlfriend from the time I ve had a rough past all kinds of abuse sexual physical mental alcohol and drugs The tipping point for that episode years ago was when I fell in love with said girlfriend at the time Who actually wasn t quite my girlfriend yet and caught her with her ex We were a thing at the time but hadn t made anything official Small things like that have been known to have a massive effect on me Well r SuicideWatch I would like to say I m an enlightened man But unfortunately I left that woman months ago Things weren t working and we weren t happy anymore But rather than try to fix it I ran away Over the past few weeks I ve began to miss Christine name changed for anonymity really very badly I found out that she has a new boyfriend with whom she is happy on the th of November I went out for my final walk Unfortunately though I had planned to jump from a bridge I neglected to think about which one and as it turns out there are or within a square mile radius of my home None of them are high enough And so I m sat again words revolving around my head over and over Except now I m thinking of various other methods The point of my post wasn t so that people would read it I know people will And I know most people will probably try to console me,"Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Mood Tracking","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Maladaptive Coping, Mental Distress, Mood Tracking, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

Too sick and poor to liveSicknesses I am blind in one eye scarred retina from birth have hypothyroidism and an undiagnosed stomach condition that I was told was barrette s stomach gastro paresis or my kidneys aren t filtering my blood correctly some sort of porphyria I get nauseated after every other meal I puke dry heave for hours and sit in a hot shower until it turns cold and then sit in a cold shower for an hour until I am nearly hypothermic Sometimes when in the hot water I dump ice water over my head to body shock the sickness away for a few seconds This gives me terrible colds that just add to the misery I ended up in the hospital for four days when I became so dehydrated that my kidneys were shutting down and my muscles were cramping up from lack of sodium I was given scopolamine Zofran and morphine When I was stable enough to hold down a bite of pancake they sent me home with a forty thousand dollar hospital bill and the recommendation that I see a specialist I applied for charity assistance from the hospital and have not seen a hospital bill since so I hope that money is not owed anymore A few months later I was lucky enough to get decent affordable health insurance which I used to get every test conceivable These tests went on for years and I was never given a definitive diagnosis My mother had end stage COPD and congestive heart failure She was on oxygen and could not leave the house She couldn t even make herself a meal without nearly suffocating to death My step father had throat cancer and liver cancer My step father had radiation treatment for the throat and liver but the throat cancer came back He then had a full laryngectomy When he came home from the hospital he was on a feeding tube and I had to crush his pills and feed him a liquid diet through his feeding tube He also needed his stoma cleaned and suctioned and a surgical wound that opened up packed and treated I did all this while also making meals for my mother doing the store runs laundry cleaning house and dealing with my own sickness The day after my th birthday in July my mother died from heart failure My Step father had been home from the hospital for one week when she passed and could not even speak They were married for years My step father s liver cancer has now come back and I fear he doesn t have long My finances I have been out of work for the past years I moved in with my mother and step father when I got too sick to work It worked out well for the three of us for the past years because despite my illness I was still able to take care of my terminally ill parents We were able to survive financially because of my parents disability checks and long term settlement check of per month and two rentals properties that were owned with no mortgage as long as there were renters anyway My uncles and my grandfather s ex wife which he was married to for years after the passing of his first wife of years now have complete control and ownership of the two rental units This past year the sickness has subsided somewhat and I want to get back to work but am afraid Afraid that the sickness will hit at work and get me fired again afraid to get back into to job market after being out for so long I inherited and now own my home with no mortgage but cannot pay the property taxes and insurance I am told I cannot take a mortgage out on my house because I don t have a job I also inherited a per month settlement check that will run out in two years It is not enough to live off and pay the taxes and insurance I also had to hire a lawyer in order to get the house and checks because my mother s will was not valid due to having been notarized with only one witness not two as per my state s law I still owe that lawyer dollars I am racking up penalties for the taxes I have yet to pay I will also be losing my health insurance at the end of this month because the premiums are going up by for the lowest tier plan It will be extremely difficult to try and find a roommate to move into the house because the house is in a state of disrepair and my terminally ill step father is in the master bedroom Who would want to move in with one sick dude and one terminally ill dude Plus the bedrooms are tiny I have two uncles One is in credit card debt and will offer no help the other has gifted me dollars since my mother s death but I cannot ask for more I have no idea how I am going to pay the bills next month I owe to a lawyer in medical bills that I know of in student loan debt in property taxes that are accruing penalties and about dollars a month in expenses insurance electric water etc I have A home valued by the city at but would sell for maybe due to that state of disrepair and per month for the next two years My plan I will leave a hand written will valid in this state leaving the house to my step father I will then acquire a small boat or kayak I will load a back pack with weights and travel as far east into the Atlantic Ocean as I can in one night Enjoy the stars and one last sunrise I will them get into the water wearing the backpack while hanging off the edge of the boat Then I will shoot myself through the brain This way if the bullet does not kill me the water will My body will sink into the depths below and that will be the end of me There will be no clean up no coroner no funeral just gone disappeared from the world My stepfather and I have never been super close and have grown father apart since the death of my mother I am alone in this life and wanted to put this out where someone might read it since I have no

"Hey. So life is pretty rough and has been getting progressively worse for the last 8 years. Lately I've been getting literally spirals from the moment I wake up to the moment I sleep. Every single day. It's causing so many issues for me to even function. I try coping mechanisms, deep breathing doesn't help. It's stopping me from doing anything creative... The finished project just ends up a disaster because I can't get into any kind of flow which only makes me belittle myself more. 
 
 Sadly I don't really have any support I can go to. I'm in therapy but sadly I can only have a session every few weeks. I don't have any friends or a family i can speak to. Meditation I try to get in when I can (I'm in a chaotic house with no privacy) it sometimes helps but usually the spiral over runs it and often the house is too loud. 
 
 I'm also unemployed with no money so getting out to get a coffee or something isn't an option. Walks in nature help but often the spirals come back the moment I get home. I would happily do them for longer but I'm worried it'll get to the expense of my daily life. 
 
 I'm spamming this group lately because I'm getting into these spirals and I don't know what else to do with that cursed mindset... It makes it worse anyway, but by the time I'm ready want to go to sleep my brain is going the ""just end it"" route really intensely every single day. I'm waking up and thinking here we go another day of this and I don't know how to make it better.",Miscellaneous,"Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

GreyLife is grey I remember a time when I used to see color I remember a time when I felt involved I remember a time when I could see a big plot in my head about how my life was going to go I remember when life seemed like a bright opportunity to me But as I grew older I came to realize that life is entirely pointless There is nothing I wish to accomplish I don t even want to survive I don t want to work I don t want to go to school I don t want friends I don t want partners I want to disappear from the rest of society like a ghost and just do what I wilt no more hunger no more fatigue no more authority There are some things I enjoy in my life I maintain a very active lifestyle and eat well I love rapping exercise and spearfishing That s it That s where my ambitions end I don t think I could ever make music my career because I don t want to go to school which you have to do if you really want to work with the technical side of music I write and write and sing and sing day in and day out another bar and another beer and another freestyle But it s going nowhere I m so poor I don t even know how to get anywhere with my music I have nothing to record it I don t know many other musicians I struggle to make friendships all I do is wander the streets of my little beach town getting drunk with the hobos and rapping People always love my stuff which always makes my day a little better But it doesn t pay the bills so why does it matter anyway money is the only thing of true value in the eyes of the human Unfortunately the majority of waking human life is a treacherous worthless fucking lie where you slave away to no end till you wind up dead like everyone else anyways No big party Life is not fun Human life is a miserable fucking struggle born out of a omnivorous ape growing too smart for its own good Life is not meant to be enjoyed it s made to be fought against till it inevitably defeats you in one way or another Maybe it defeats you with a bus or cardiac arrest or a fucking plane crash At least that d be more exciting than pathetically slitting my own wrists in a public bathroom so my mom doesn t have to find my dead body I m and I m watching from the sidelines as my peers get married go to school move out enjoy their pointless lives somehow I m just resigned to my tiny corner of life alone and having no place in this void I watch them and know in my heart I ll never catch up I never fucking will I was not born to survive this cycle I was born with a broken mind and a weak soul I try to express myself through music and poetry and it does help but it realistically gets me nowhere in this life other than impressing girls and wowing people sometimes I have no ambition I have no clear cut path to follow so I just wander into nothingness and twiddle my thumbs hoping something pops up from out of the fog of life It s a very hopeless feeling Love is the same thing every time you feel it the circumstances just change Hatred is the same thing every time you feel it the level of intensity just changes based on your perception I feel like after experiencing all the basic human emotions I ve run my course I ve had years to observe how this all works and I m formally opting out of it before the next cycle starts worse and more intense than the last cycles I ve run through I m weary and sick of repeating myself like I m stuck on a loop making the same mistakes burning my bridges anytime I build them lying around because it doesn t feel like there s anything better to do This life is boring and then hard and then more boring Fuck this shit I m out,"Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Positive Coping, Seeking Help, Progress Update, Mood Tracking, Cause of Distress","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Mood Tracking, Positive Coping, Seeking Help"

I m having a really hard time convincing myself to keep going I ll try to keep this brief About years ago I decided to try and turn my life around I went back to school and moved to another state to return to school While there I lost lbs decided to pursue a professional degree i e like an MD made some wonderful friends and had a couple of very meaningful relationships Fast forward to the end of my time there and I had been accepted into the top schools in the country and was just finishing up my studies I decided to end my relationship of years with a girl for both good and bad reasons but ultimately I ve come to regret that decision Without going into details I have a hard time forming connections with others so being able to get that close with someone is something very special I decided to go to the school closest to my home because I was feeling homesick at the time due to being away for nearly years When I arrived I was lonely and a little out of shape but excited to start school Things were going well until midway through the first year a classmate of mine nearly attempted suicide himself he had brought a gun into his dorm and was going to shoot himself I convinced him no to do it and went with him to the counselor the next day For whatever reason this had a profound impact on me and sent me into a depression I started seeing a therapist myself and hired a private trainer at the school gym to try and get myself back in shape and address my feelings Things were going OK for the most part going into the second year of my schooling I was very lonely and somewhat disappointed with my choice in school but otherwise I was looking forward to the future because I was cultivating some interesting hobbies I was enjoying working out rock climbing guitar drawing and kayaking During the Christmas break of that year I fell and injured both of my wrists snowboarding for the first time I didn t think much of it at the time but after a month they still hurt and felt unstable I got diagnosed with a torn ligament in my wrist and a couple other complications I was unable to workout like I normally would due to this injury I refocused on school and spent my time there I also got a highly coveted internship at a local hospital When I wasn t focused on my studies my mind dwelled on my wrist I decided to try and rehab my knee I had slightly injured it the summer before I started professional school but I ended up injuring my wrist further doing an exercise the PT had me do Frustrated I gave up trying to rehab my knee At the start of the third year in pharmacy school I had worked during the summer and also done research on the side My health had deteriorated due to not working out and some stress eating The school I chose proved to be a massive disappointment with a disconnected administration filler classes and a seemingly glaring neglect of fundamental concepts I slogged through the year my health concerns continuing to to weigh heavily on me my TMJ became particularly worse and I injured my other wrist I decided in December to leave my internship which was upsetting me and to try pilates as an alternative workout Now I ve found that due to a defect in my hip I have torn cartilage there as well in addition to knee and ankle problems The surgical outcomes for my hip seem more optimistic than my wrist but I m scared of surgery because of past experiences and I m losing a lot of faith in modern medicine I ve tried pursuing relationships during school but as I said earlier I have trouble with trust and I also feel myself pulling back because my health concerns might limit me It also depresses me that the person I end up with will see me as this broken thing and not the driven hard working capable person I was and was trying hard to improve In addition to my health problems I am having difficulty finding more interests to pursue Writing drawing hurts my wrist as does playing guitar I had wanted to hike and backpack more maybe even run but my hip is making that unlikely I also developed a condition known as slipping rib syndrome which makes certain actions very painful difficult I feel like I tried so hard to change who I was years ago and that it s all going to be for nothing I cultivated new interests that I can t do I m stuck at a school I hate taking on debt for something I ve lost the passion in and I am having difficulty romantically because I feel like I can t form a relationship with someone that I d want to because I don t think my health will allow a future with them In a nut shell I feel like I ve lost my identity and died I ve tried several alternatives to try and pick myself up but I seem to keep hitting roadblocks I went from an active person to nearly completely sedentary and my health seems to be deteriorating at a rapid rate with no definitive answers I think of killing myself multiple times a day but what stops me is that I keep hoping I ll get better It has been over a year since I ve injured my wrist and no doctor has given me a definitive treatment answer that I am satisfied with they just seem to go through treatment algorithms rather than think of mine case as unique Now with my hip knee ankle injury I m rapidly losing hope that I ll ever be able to enjoy my life when I m done with schooling Thank you for reading this I m sorry it was so long I just feel like I need someone to understand how hard I have tried and how desperate I m starting to feel I feel so lost and overwhelmed that I can t pull myself out of this I wish someone was there just to feel close

I m still not even sure if I m depressed or not but I m thinking bout wanting to be dead On my th different anti depressant all with negative side effects and nothing noticeably positive The psychologist I was seeing said he doesn t think he can help me and then he said I m a little shit and told my mom she shouldn t put up with me at all My mother says she feels like I ve never appreciated anything she has done for me ever I was failing in college so I dropped out after already going to all several different tutoring sources I honestly was trying my hardest back then The only job I had was mccdonalds for months was employee of the month once lol now I m k in debt because I don t see any reason to go on living everyone in my life seems to absolutely hate me and I have a lot of anxiety talking to people so meeting new people is gunna suck too and work sucks too I don t like video games or music much any more either If I do it my mom says she will be really sad but she also said I don t appreciate her at all and she just generally doesn t like me My best friend would be sad but he has a lot of other friends so he d be fine and we only really hang out maybe time a year anyways not much impact My brother steals from me so I don t really feel like that s a healthy relationship anyways My sister is pretty nice but she lives over k miles away and we barely ever talk anyways She generally says I m an ass and the last time she was around she was threatening to call the police on me for some reason that s everyone in my life at this time basically Basically I have no obligations to anyone I don t feel love from anyone in my life they say that I m terrible to them I don t enjoy meeting new people because all the irrational fear I don t want to work because I see no point in making money if I don t enjoy anything that much Yes I can enjoy things like eating a good food or something is still pleasurable it s just overall it doesn t feel worth it to me,"Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Seeking Help, Progress Update, Mood Tracking, Cause of Distress","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Maladaptive Coping, Mental Distress, Mood Tracking, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

Suicide watch after a DUI arrest I was referred to this subreddit and it is highly applicable I don t mean to deflect but I m asking for a friend He s a great guy simply he carries a lot of baggage Some context to the current question My friend is a former member of the armed forces for the United States of America His experience was difficult to accept and it s taken a toll on him psychologically He previously was an excellent athlete and now centralizes his lifestyle around marijuana nicotine and alcohol We both attend a university in a college town and returned from our spring break yesterday afternoon Last night he drove with blood alcohol concentration over I received a call this morning from his father asking me to ensure he doesn t act drastically Legal action will be required promptly and I fear that the absence of his vehicle impounded will allow him to dwell in his thoughts to a fault He owns quite a few guns and his stability is my primary concern I am staying at his household overnight and he had some friends stop by throughout the day yet I do not foresee this being a long term fix He has acknowledged the circumstances in a constructive manner yet becomes frustrated when grasping the consequences of his actions In closing he has great character solely the baggage he carries weighs him down to the point that he wants to quit his continuation and he perceived his actions last night as justification I told him he should not define himself by one night and I was hoping to acquire some knowledge from anyone with personal experience to better provide encouragement I appreciate your consideration,"Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Seeking Help, Mood Tracking","Critical Risk, Maladaptive Coping, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

my parents yelled at me for self harming i ve been feeling empty since or really anxious i want to kill my self i don t want to do this shit anymore i m feeling so suicidal it was around days ago i took half a bar of xan i was hella loopy and shit and got really depressed the night before i made a pretty bad cut and i wanted to go deeper i stumbled for my box cutter and cut i reached fat i was bleeding a lot but i wasn t panicking i put gauze and wrapped it up rly tight i called my friend for around minutes and all i remember was saying i m gonna die over and over again i vividly remember his disappointed yet calm voice saying you re not going to die idk how but i hung up i don t remember much after but i know i took the other half and blacked out with no other memory of what happened i have videos of me on snap talking to myself saying shit like i don t have any real friends when i woke up my head was killing me and my cut was still bleeding w yellow shit coming out of it too i was really worried of infection the night before my dad saw my cut and just put triple anti biotic and medical tape on it so that s what i did for days i told some online friends and they were really worried especially my boyfriend they all were telling me to go to my parents and get stitches but i didn t have enough strength to the first day the days passed and i was getting worried yellow shit was still coming out of it and i got paranoid it was infected so i told my older sister who s she was really worried when she saw it and she made jokes about it that kind of made me feel better but hurt sometimes she decided the best thing was to get my parents i was panicking and didn t want to do i got her to get them downstairs they asked if i did it to myself i said yes they began yelling at me fueled with anger my dad was squeezing my arm and touching my cuts that hurt like hell my mom was the most angry i held back tears but their yelling is what made me cry she was cursing at me making me feel like shit for waking them up it s all a blur really but i remember saying i just feel like a burden my mom laughed and said i was being dramatic and kept saying omg that s how i felt though like a weight being dragged around constantly needing help that i don t ask for my mom made me sleep in her room my dad on the couch like always i begged to just sleep on the couch or in my sisters room but she just said no which i understand i couldn t sleep that night her room even in our old house makes me uneasy i m wide awake my insomnia didn t help either my dad took my phone i was grounded from seeing my friends my room etc i just wanted a hug support from them but what did i expect my parents have always been abusive idk why i didn t guess they d make me feel even shittier to make matters worse both my psychiatrist and therapist just moved so no more of that my pills have been needing refills for weeks but it never happened they never took my depression seriously i ve been diagnosed with depression anxiety ocd add an insomnia i withdrawal from my meds and drugs like weed and xan the next morning i woke up early like early i spent the day watching the office i just wanted to laugh my mom of course got angry but didn t do much about it i changed my bandaids on my own my parents didn t bother with it too much even though it was at an extreme risk of infection i asked friends and strangers if it looked infected and read how to keep it clean there was still puss coming out which wasn t normal i asked my mom but she blew it off i didn t know what to do but keep cleaning it i slept in my sisters room that night the next day my day had bought spray on liquid bandage that i ve never heard of i found out later it should be used for minor cuts he sprayed it inside of the cut i have a high pain tolerance but i almost cried he kept pinching my cuts i told him i could do it but he kept denying it i put on more medical tape and it hurt all day i regret telling them so much my friend recommended calling suicide hotline to get cps involved but i couldn t do that to my younger sister so i never did ive been feeling pretty empty even right now my cuts have healed pretty well but my mind has blocked out a lot of the memory of what happened my friend the one i called the night of told me yesterday you know you said something the night u made that cut that really stuck with me you said you weren t even scared or anxious you just did it cause it felt so good is that true i was shocked at that i didn t know what to say i knew it was true but i didn t want it to be i told my boyfriend and he was really scared he told me imagine how scary it is for me trying to have a life w you and not knowing if i can cos idk if youll be alive i felt awful the first deep cut i did i told him he was focused on how he felt and how much i hurt him it sucked but we ve gotten through it don t get me wrong he s absolutely amazing and everything i could ask for i know how hard it is to handle something like this i m paranoid a lot he s going to find someone better or he s lying that he loves me he s always reassuring me though i feel bad for having so many problems he has to deal with i ve been feeling the urge to cut and do xan more and more i haven t though i m trying to get through it i feel hopeless and constantly tired all the time i wish to be dead at times wishing i could disappear the times i ve tried killing myself and fail i feel like i can t do anything right i cant wait to move out of my house i want this all to be over i m so scared constantly i feel like no one cares and no ones going to read this if you did thank you for sticking to the end it means a lot,"Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Positive Coping,

I feel like I m losing my mind and I don t know what to do I keep thinking about killing myself I have been on Lexapro for anxiety and depression for about months now and recently stopped taking them due to running out of refills I have not taken them in about a week when I am used to taking them daily I have never felt so horrible in my entire life I ve called my pharmacy and asked them to refill it but they cannot because my psychiatrist has not responded to them I called my psychiatrist and left a message with her in hopes she ll get back to me soon but I feel like I m losing my fucking shit I had a complete mental shut down last Tuesday and laid motionless and basically comatose crying naked on my bathroom floor for an hour before my boyfriend found me and put me in my bed and tried taking care of me It took me several hours to start talking and be normal again These past two days in particular have been so difficult I feel like I have no control over my emotions or thoughts The voices inside my head are constantly screaming these horrible things at me it s like I m living the intro to BoJack Horseman s Stupid Piece of Sh t episode with his inner monologue I feel like I have rat shit for brains and I feel so uneasy and I can t make myself stable I m so terrified and I constantly keep thinking about killing myself I don t actually want to die but I can t make myself stop and it s destroying me I m trying desperately to cope but I quite literally cannot scrounge up any functioning ounce of myself to do so I ve made an appointment with a local counseling center and am hoping they ll be getting back to me soon I just need to be back on my medication before I fall completely off the deep end If anyone has any advice on how to try to and cope and how to try and stabilize my thoughts and mood I would greatly appreciate it I don t know if I m going to be able to make it to the end of the week if I m like this I m currently on the phone with a crisis hotline hoping to get something out of it,"Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Seeking Help, Progress Update, Mood Tracking","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Maladaptive Coping, Mental Distress, Mood Tracking, Progress Update, Seeking Help"
