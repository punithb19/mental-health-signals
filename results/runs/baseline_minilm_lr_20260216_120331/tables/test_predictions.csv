"I grew up mostly dating men but realized when I was a teenager that I also like women. I know for sure that I am attracted to women, but I go off and on with feeling or knowing if I like men. Do I dislike my male ex’s because they did me wrong or because I forced myself to date men through compulsory heterosexuality?
 A few years ago I did believe that I was a lesbian, then went back to bisexual a year later. Now I feel like I am a lesbian again but honestly I really am not sure.
 I label myself as queer now because I don’t know if I truly fit into the bisexual category or lesbian category. I wish I didn’t have so many identity issues so that I wasn’t so worried about this/may be able to understand myself easier and not struggle so much with my identity.","Cause of Distress, Mood Tracking",Miscellaneous

I can t take this no more the agony is killing me LONG STORY SHORT So my name is Alfred Florin and I have been suffering from ocd pure o since I was I am now From a very young age I shook hands with Ocd and had anxiety problems but they were not a big deal it was present or days then it would go away without a huge effort When I was the sickness struck hard and I felt its presence so hard like it was a possession I will get there too but now let s continue the story My first ocd encounter was when I have stepped on a guy s foot when I was I guess You may be wondering what s wrong with that or what that means Well in Romania there is a urban myth it goes like this if you step on someone s foot and that person doesn t step on your back your mother dies Well there were many people around me cause it was the mayor elecrion that day and after I have stepped on that guy s foot I couldn t figure where he went cause it happened fast and then he disappeared in the crowd in an instant Well when I got home I thought at the fact that my mom could be dead cause I have stepped on that guy s foot I wasn t really scared or anything just a little worried I know it s stupid even for a year old but yeah Well I guess hours passed and I started thinking in that obsessive way that my mom will die and etc bad thoughts my chest started burning and everything I would say to fight it back I couldn t get me to believe that it s not real I have started crying and the pain made me feel like my life was ruined Well it passed really soon I guess the next day I was kind of ok I DID NOT TELL ANYONE ABOUT IT After that experience till age I had various exeperiences like that one but it did not bother me on the long run Let me give some examples I was thinking at biomechanics and had some repetitive body movements I couldn t stop from doing them until I felt like I had hit the right spot or the movement was the right one I once sae a really f cked up thing on a website it was a soup made of a fetus Well after I saw that my mind started telling me that I would enjoy it and would like to eat it And I couldn t stop from imagining myself from eating it even though I hated these images it was pure hell cause I was a religious person and that made me feel like I had let God down Whenever I would go to church I would imagine Jesus and Mary having sex and I just couldn t stop thinking and I would get images and mind movies and I would just leave church feeling like CRAP It made me feel like I was such a bad person and I was actually crippled by these thoughts but it went off really fast and it did not affect my life on the long run I repeat I had periods when I would feel bad and depressed and felt a ache in my chest and it was just like my soul hurt not my chest I was really emotional all of a sudden I would get scared easily and cry really fast Let me talk to you abot age I had a friend at that did not believe in Jesus and we would argue all day long about religous stuff and I was explaining to him thing every single day about hours a day every damn day and that caused me a lot of stress but I really wanted to help him and I felt like it was my duty to stop his tears with the help of God Well one day I was sitting at my computer and one of his questions about god popped into my head I have tried to answer it myself but I couldn t get the answer right so I have seesrched it on google saw different responses but guess what not a single answer made me feel ok I felt a thirst of truth and the next minutes my chest lighted up little by little and the pain was getting stronger I was searching and searching for an answer and guess what That question transformed into questions per second In my mind I felt a tornado of questions making my soul and my brain hurt like no other thing in this world That day I have spent it wandering the streets cause I just couldn t sit still My chest and soul were on fire and my mind was full of questions I was walking like a mad man and looking straight into nothingness while while walking and trying to give myself a answer to all of the questions while slowly strating to realize that I was going to hell cause I started doubting God and its works and that made my chest EXPLODE and I have bursted into tears and the biggest and badeest panick attack I have ever experienced and the first My mom came home from work and I was keep telling her that my soul aches and I do not know what to do she was distressed by my situation but she was thinking that it s only a teenage thing and it will pass Nightime came and the pain and question were just king of gone but they were omnipresent Before bed I was a disaster I got down on my knees and prayed like tomorrow was the end of days but the next day the same thing happened It got to the point that I had to sleep with my mom and listen to the radio all night long and all day long just not to hear BRAIN THAT WAS TELLING ME THAT I WAS GOING TO HELL AND I HAD IMAGES OF ME BURNING IN HELL GLUED TO MY MIND AND SOUL Well It went like this for months until my father came home from abroad and went with me to a psychiatrist and thing went ok for a while but that psychiatrist did not care about me and it took years for me to understand that it was wrong seeing her She gave me the same pills all these years and we never did therapy but I had a fear of leaving the treatment behind and leaving my psychiatrist cause I thought no one would understand and I continued on for years the fifth year I was off pils off seeing a psychiatrist etc while I was seeing the psychiatrist everything was bad but it was bearable My life was shit but I could cope with it In these years i have been through all of the branches of OCD I had HOCD fobias Religious ocd blah blah I guess I had tasted all of it The Hocd wrecked my life but I went through it like a champ This last year the fifth I met Laura and my new ocd chapter began RETROACRIVE JEALOUSY IS MY PRIMARY ENEMY NOW It s not like I dont have the scars of my other ocd episodes I still was depreseed angry and full of pain when I met her but one thing I wasn t Hopeless I had a hope that I would get better I have met her march she was different she had sexual some really colorful sexual experiences and she seamed slutty She was talking to me about her sexual past and black men in her life and how she cheated on her ex cause she was horny and stuff We kissed one night and I saw something in her something special even if she talked like she did but I like her as a person she was funny and she had a nice personality We were toghether and one day I just couldn t stop thinking at these men she has been with and how she talked to me about them and my ocd started kicking after months in the reltionship my ocd came in and ruined us in a way I was unabe to please her sexualy unable to kiss her It got to the point where I wanted to break up because of it And i was at inch of doing it but we got through it and we were kind of ok not good but ok Well we were toghether i was getting ready for an exam in august when I found put that she cheated o me in june with her ex Alin several times in that month and they have been talking from some time I guess they started talking in april after I have found that in august I forgave her and was strict with her for a month so she would understand that she did wrong and it wrecked our relationship In that period an anger lighted up in me ai started talking to my ex too but nothing romantic or so just random talk I did not touch her or anything I have stopped talking to her at the middle of september cause I feel like that anger wasn t doing me any good and I need to forgive her Well everthing went really good until I found out that she has been in a club one night on the date of of september and she went with her best friend that recently got into a relationship guess with who the dude with she cheated on her ex Alin with he s called Paul she went to the club with Paul her best friend Andreea and Teodor a dude wich she has been seeing while she was in a relationship with her ex That night she got drunk she did drugs and she asked Teodor why did we stop seeing eachother and when he left she asked are you leaving my here with these crazies paul and andreea at the end of the night she was spitted on by a dude cause she intervened while he was shouting at Paul that he wants to fight him and Laura said fight me the he spitted her Teodor said Laura asked him to come back and take her back home to chill but she said that it is not true She lied to me about many things and I don t know what to believe I forgave her but after that night My ocd started wrecking my life again After I found this I contacted my ex and slept with her put of anger I did it with her twice and I regret it because I did not feel anything for her Laura found and she got over it Problem is we are ok with a new start though I don t trust her like some time ago and I can t stop asking her questions and details about her past and she cheating me how she did it why minor details anything I get an answer i feel better for an hour then it kicks again and I can t stop getting mental movies and images and hearing things about her and other man ablut her and Teodor Alin Paul and etc I really need to get back on track but it seems really hard I have told her that in order for this to work she need to stop talking to other men going to club stol doing this stop doing that etc is it right What am I doing I will go to a specialist who really cares but until then Please help me every word matters please tell me if my relationship is worth anything Would you forgive what would you do I just cant stop getting images and my brain tells me that she betrayed me twice not just once with Alin but twice with that night in the club and that I am not good enough and my self esteem is wrecked I can t even go for a walk cause everytime I do I see someone more muscular or more attractive than me in any way my ocd teels me that my girlfriend will like him cause he is better or that she look at him and admires him ai get really jealous and I lock myself into a shell Sometimes I feel like I am just like a little a wounded boy who just wants to be understood and loved and its hard because we live in a really plastic and harsh world Nobody cares about feeling no more and we all chase the money like hell Sorry for the grammar mistakes if you spot some but I am not well Thanks for reading,"Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping,

 i feel so so trapped and miserable im trying prozac again as i still had some extra from the last time i was on it hopefully it works well enough to get through a follow up appointment for more meds my anxiety is getting steadily worse since last december i used to be able to attend zoom meetings for more meds but the last time i tried to do that i had a horrible disassociating panic attack and had to cancel last minute going to the dentist to check for a cavity involved actual screaming and crying i had to reach a point of panic attack where i had gone numb and disassociated then i needed my partner to physically help me into the building i honestly dont know what to do in order to get help i have to push through my anxiety but when i try to do that my brain fully shuts down i cant answer questions and i get compelled to hit myself unfortunately sometimes i cant help myself and just start becoming violent towards myself only ever towards myself thankfully nothing permanently damaging just jarring and horrifying to feel almost possessed into hitting myself
 ive tried multiple meds ive tried every diy therapy tactic imaginable ive scoured resources for coping mechanisms nothing works when i get to a certain level of stress i shut down theres no coping or breathing through what feels like a complete shutdown of the brain i dont know how to get help at this point if one of my big three anxieties could go away i know it would help so much i just dont understand how to address any of those problems i need help honestly i dont know what im gonna do","Mood Tracking, Positive Coping","Cause of Distress, Mental Distress, Mood Tracking, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

I want to kill myself next month on my birthday Turning I have some sort of mental illness I don t know what I have a few theories but I d hate to self diagnose It use to be manageable I had a very loving girlfriend who use to help me and make me feel better I was always open about myself to her but I wasn t very open about my darkside until towards the end of our relationship She realized how bad it was Likewise she also suffered from mental illness and along with that she survived through various forms of abuse throughout her life She broke up with me because I made an egregious mistake which though wasn t built on bad intentions was horrid in its affect I hurt her and I can only hope that she gets better I love her so so much We re trying to be friends but it s obvious that it hurts her healing process to talk to me She was the only person who I felt ever actually cared for me She was the one person who I ever felt emotionally secure with She was the one person who I felt actively cared for me and my well being in that she would worry about me and check up on me Now I don t have her and now I have nothing Its my fault I just want to hug her I hate the way time works When something happens it happens and theres no way you can change it My relationship with my parents is strange My dad is an alcoholic and probably bipolar Sometimes he and I get along but when I m being myself he often calls me weird strange retarded pretentious etc He does it jokingly often times ganging up with my sister on me but it still hurts I go along with it and laugh it off but it hurts He s suicidal The only time I ve seen him in two months was for Thanksgiving I m worried he is going to kill myself out of loneliness as he has no one as well and that it would be my fault for not having seen him recently My mom is very nice and cool but for some reason I just hate it when she talks to me I know one reason is because when I do rarely get emotional she talks to other people about it or makes a bigger deal out of it than the situation warrants or tries to pity me which I also hate I don t like it when she knows things about me because she tries to solve it and because again she tells people about it or will use the information to embarrass me at family events which are already tough for me My sister hates me I think Really I think I m a burden on everyone s life in my family but I m trying to avoid platitudes I think she hates me because she always gets pissed when I talk She ll whisper with my mom when I m out of the room about how inconsiderate and lazy I am Recently I came out of my room to the living room to try to socialize with my mom and sister and when I was responding admittedly annoyed by whatever the fuck she was just huffing and puffing and gritting her teeth at my mom as I talked to her and finally my sister said What the fuck is your problem dude To which my mom said Hey no cussing And then my sister said Just talking to my name Implying that any conversation with me will devolve into her cussing at me My mom laughed School is awful I use to have good grades I was in the gifted classes up till middle school Starting getting sad all the time and lonely and my grades began to slip Went to an awful middle school my th grade year and dropped out to go to school online within a quarter of the year The next year I had to transfer over from the high school that would have taken in the middle school I went to and instead to a different school Because of my transfer student status I have to have above a C in everything and less than absences All of this was doable but my depression got worse this year as the year progressed and my grades got worse and worse and my attendance got worse Now I have three D s Two of which can be feasibly increased to a C The point being that I will most likely have to return to my jurisdiction Go to a school where I won t belong and know no one I ll miss her at school I ll get even more depressed I know I ll start to skip I ll have even less emotional support than I do now So I have no one No emotional support No sympathy from others No friends Nothing I ll probably have to move schools which is one of three connections I have to her the other being our jobs we work at the same place and social media texting I lost the one person I ve ever truly cared about and that has ever cared about me and its because of me and I hurt her I m losing passion for the one thing I think I m good at My birthday is in a month and I will have no one to make me happy All this is temporary but it shows a pattern I am mentally ill in some way I will always struggle and I am too cowardly to continue trudging if I am alone Sometimes I fantasize about running away somewhere warm and just dying alone Taking refuge in my own soul Completely unbothered by other people Not expecting the love of others Just knowingly dying by myself I ordered four books on amazon James Joyce by Richard Ellman fairy tales by ee cummings Catcher in the Rye by J D Salinger and Lust for Life by Irving Stone and I m hoping they will all come in before my birthday so I can read them beforehand If not then I will read what I can But I really don t want to keep doing this I don t like it I m not happy I don t think I ever will be nor do I think I deserve it I m just done,"Critical Risk, Mental

"I have so many stressors in my life, all major things that tear me down. Every day I fight a battle not just with my mental health but with the world. Last night I finally broke. After 33 years of a shit show of a life, I am done. What ultimately triggered this is that my son (7m) with ADHD has been expelled from holiday club. I quit my job Jan 2020 because he was not coping in school and managed to find him a specialist educational provider as well as get him on medication. He did brilliantly! I however, hated being a SAHM and a carer. The loneliness is overwhelming and the fact that I only live to provide food and a clean house to 3 children. So, I started to think about going back to work in my area of specialty which is law. I got a job with a police department. Something for me and something where I will meet other adults without being attached to my children. I got all 3 of my children into a childcare provider and settled them in over months. I have officially been working for less than 2 weeks and my son has regressed back to his bad behaviour. He has been kicked out and now I have to quit my job and go back to being his full time carer. I cannot do this for the next 11 years of his life and possibly beyond that. I do not want to live anymore and there is no help out there for my situation. I can go back on antidepressants, I can go to therapy but none of these things fix my problem that I no longer have any autonomy over my life. I am not a person any more, I am merely a mum with no identity other than that of my children. I find no pleasure in anything and exhaust myself pretending to be happy for the sake of my family. I cannot work, and now as it turns out I cannot even die. I cannot leave behind my children, I am their only parent. I have no control in this life over anything. I now think I am too far gone to ever feel happy again. I want to die. I cannot go back to Groundhog Day",Critical Risk,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

Most days my brain is just silently AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIt s like this indescribable emotional pain mixed with an intense almost overwhelming desire for life to end all resulting in a feeling as if there s a corner of my brain just screaming endlessly TL DR Shoutout to everyone here trying to get on with life with a brain that wants to die Posting here because I can t act anymore I can t pretend that everything is okay I ve gained kg in a week from eating rubbish which is super yuck but I also don t care because my brain has been swamped by intense suicidal ideation and if I m not sufficiently distracted the thoughts about suicide come back in like BLAM BLAM BLAM BLAM just drowning out everything else I think about self harming a lot I mean not only suicide but other forms of physical pain But then I remember I ve got way too many scars already and additional scars and a high pain tolerance doesn t change anything I don t have a good reason to want to die There s no major crisis The relationship breakdown was over months ago and I m mostly over that I have enough money for everything I essentially need Sure I ll probably need several more major operations because genetics suck and I ll definitely need a double mastectomy at some point because cancer risk but that s not it either It s not even the fact that I have about three friends and the last time I hung out with a friend was in February because at the moment people are too exhausting for me to want to have any interaction with I don t want anything to do with anyone right now I can t pretend to not be depressed when I m around other people anymore It takes all of my energy to pretend to be normal and smile and laugh at work and I know I don t do a very good job at that as it is It s not really any of that I just don t care anymore About any of it Any of life I am amazed I have been together enough to do things like shower and brush my teeth and pay bills and work days a week Do look pale and run down as shit though Going through the motions I guess while my brain is screaming I want to die all the while It s gotten to the point where I m thinking about suicide all day every day I suspect it s the general anaesthetic I had from a colonoscopy in May sending me off the deep end into post operative depression but also the general state of the world Now I know if I stopped eating crap and did more exercise and got more sunshine and made more of an effort to be social I d probably feel better But it also gets to a point where you cannot bring yourself to do any of that because just getting dressed and maintaining basic personal hygiene is a mammoth achievement So I am going to my GP on Monday to ask to go back on antidepressants It might be a complete waste of time and money as it has been in the past but I can t help hoping that this time will be different that this time maybe we ll try a different drug that might actually give me the capacity to overcome the intrusive suicidal thoughts and do the exercise and the things I know I need to do for wellbeing Also going to see the psychologist on Monday It s been difficult to get an appointment a because it s bloody expensive and b because a huge chunk of the general population are under huge stresses so she s super busy and hard to get into I m hoping I have the money to continue to see her because she s the best psychologist I have ever seen I haven t kept it up because of financial stress and my mental health has suffered as a result But I think this time I should be able to stick with it for a while It s been hard because the depression has screwed with my cognitive function and sleep again too I can t concentrate for more than seconds I m agitated and drowning in anxiety all the time I go to sleep late and wake up early whether I like it or not I can t remember anything and everything takes me ten times longer to process or understand than usual and I constantly feel as dumb as a rock I wasn t entirely honest with my doctor last time I went because I didn t want to be on antidepressants again and I sure as hell didn t want to run the risk of being put in a mental hospital again But at the moment it s gotten to the point where I just don t care about anything anymore so might as well be totally upfront I think I m too lazy to actually kill myself Having been there and tried that more than once getting it right takes a lot of planning and organising and logistics I just don t have the energy for Especially because were I to go through with one of the plans for suicide I have I don t want to leave all my stuff just around for my family to deal with I d need to sort out my belongings and affairs etc etc etc and make sure I had enough money to cover any potential funeral or medical expenses if I fucked it up And that s the nub of it Human beings are both incredibly resilient and incredibly fragile creatures I think what keeps me going at times like these is that I know if I failed suicide where I was left half brain dead and still aware that that would be a fate far worse than this My life could be x worse than it currently is no doubt But knowing that doesn t change that incessant suicidal impulse blamming it s way across my brain I just wanted to put this out there because I needed to tell someone how I feel right now with completely honesty And maybe someone else will resonate with how I feel right now and it might help them feel they re not alone,"Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Positive Coping, Seeking Help,

This is my experience on thinking about suicide and being dobbed in so that my workplace gets involved part This has just happened to me today Staying home from work and I got an email from work that just made me go bitch pleeassseee Work conflicts basically caused me to become mentally ill to the point that when I get frustrated with them self harm thoughts come hand in hand with any irritation or anger It s not that I plan to kill myself but instantaneously I think in my head I want to kill myself and immediately next thought I would think OMG don t be stupid that s not going to happen That sort of goes backwards and forth until I get very worked up It feels crazy in my head and it feels I need to vent The problem here is now I don t really care about anything asides from basically bitching to someone What happened today was I bitched to a friend at work via my personal email and their work email I do say friend because I m not venting to them because it s my best friend or anything it is someone who I know personally from work and knows about other instances I thought about self harm at work and isn t very trustworthy as you are about to find out I bitch a bit and told him what I was thinking at that moment which had bits of people are lying to me again I want to kill myself I feel faint so forth Not the first time I told him that in fact I told him I locked myself in the bathroom at work because I got scared I ll self harm if I went outside and he did nothing Literally nothing He read it and didn t even check that I was alright or not or come to check on me I was literally just upstairs Anyways the point of that side story is that this is normal So back to the main story I wrote those emails early in the morning then went home and watched some TV and went to sleep After lunch my parents started phoning me up saying work contacted them and work phoned the police OK sure Not the first time work phoned the police on me and fuck them The police came What they knew was Work has phoned them telling them that I sent an email saying I d self harm suicide and they were worried because I haven t sent them anything since so they have not been in contact and they were worried if I was alive They have mixed in some truths with lies I sent an email true The bit where they make a big deal out of it a lie I had no phone calls or emails from them that day really they could ve contacted me if they wanted to However they did phone both my parents who said they were in contact with me and did not want them to phone the police and make a big deal out of it The point is I was fine I got taken to hospital for a check up and got let out the same day so the doctors didn t think there were reasons to keep me there even though they could ve done so against my will There are going to be people who hide behind a facade of care or worry who says they are doing things that they are not It s hard to tell most people want to be loved so they want to believe what they are being told is true but when you feel worse after hearing about it then something isn t right It s just better to trust your instincts People can let you down or betray your trust I m slowly getting used to people who think they can mix in some lies because people would believe them over someone like me someone with a history of mental illness seen a psychologist Those stories might be enough to send the police to your place and have you sent to hospital for an assessment but the police literally can t do anything else it s the doctors who decide Doctors at the hospital aren t going to just blindly listen to that story and going to the hospital doesn t mean that they ll keep you there against your will Why did my work place decide to lie I don t know They could be genuinely worried they could be covering their ass in case of legal problems or they could want to put me in my place for being a nuisance It really doesn t matter They can say you are mental but they are just as mental as themselves As for my friend I am still coping with the fact that he would care more about the company than my wellbeing I honestly do believe if I died he d shrug it off I ve told him I was feeling suicidal endless amounts of times before but getting personal messages like whatsapp not just emails forward off to work Part of not being about to cope makes me think about self harm want to kill myself wanting them to watch me die wanting him to regret not helping me What gets to me the most is that he pretends he is above fault I had a panic attack in front of him and he walked away telling me I should get help He did that more than once actually At the same time he s pretending he s a good guy who cares and will help when shit hits the fans He is like a human version of the workplace If I can kill myself I d make sure he gets haunted by it I used to get so upset when my workplace lied and then think about suicide even more thinking I could get back at them,"Critical

My therapist cut me off and it s got me suicidalI was seeing her pretty consistently this whole year and I ve been doing very intense work on my trauma However I had a habit of not showing up to sessions sometimes due to my depression This whole year I was going consistently and it s helped a lot In the past three weeks I did not show up because my depression was going off the rails and I had no energy I was attempting to reach her the past few days to set up an appointment and she finally got back to me telling me that she s going to have to stop seeing me due to my inconsistency I m really crushed and just broken down because of this My suicidal thoughts and ideations have been increasing in intensity the past three months but now I would say I m at a in terms of wanting to end it I realized that I should ve honored my appointments but I just feel so damn worthless now that even my therapist cuts me off Sorry,"Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Seeking Help, Progress Update, Mood Tracking, Cause of Distress","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Maladaptive Coping, Mental Distress, Mood Tracking, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

"whats after anxiety i was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder a few months ago looking back i realized anxiety had driven so much of my behavior influencing most things ive done whether good or bad
 
 the good thing is that therapy has helped me tremendously with my anxiety its not as overwhelming as it used to be and i can now distract myself when it starts brewing in my head for the first time in years i feel free and refreshed
 
 however i now feel sad that i spent so many years being miserable and im resentful towards my parents whom i see as the main source of my anxiety is this normal is it common to feel stupid and melancholic now that the anxiety is starting to faded away is it normal to feel waves after waves of negative emotions about anxiety and the causes of it","Mood Tracking, Positive Coping","Mood Tracking, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

How to masturbate for men You really don t have to masturbate if you don t want to no actual benefits But if you do want to here is how to do it can t believe I m typing this but let s go There are methods for male masturbation there is anal but I have never done it and I am not knowledged in the slightest about it Standing and laying however you can perform the standing technic laying and the laying technic standing it s just refering to how they are most commonly performed First for all find some time to do it I suggest getting about minutes of free time Then find someplace where your semen won t be a problem and isn t shared by anyone else other than someone you are in a relationship with Then get something to clean it A good wipe will do You can then find something to do it to It doesn t have to be porn or lewd doesn t even have to be a picture you can even use your imagination although keep in mind it s easy to get distracted Then do it in hours when you won t fall asleep during the masturbation sadly I am guilty of that one Also do it fully naked You don t want stains on your clothes You can also use a form of lubrication but that is optional unless you are doing anal stimulation Now on how to do the standing method Get in a comfortable position then undress yourself Get a grasp of your penis in your palm and start stroking it As gentle rough or however you feel like Don t worry no harm will be done to your foreskin Just keep going whilst slightly stroking faster and faster until you ejaculate That really is it all Now on how to do the laying method Undress yourself and find a soft object Then just rub your penis or your entire body on that object until you ejaculate Keep in mind that that object WILL get stained no matter how much you try not to stain it That s pretty much it Now if you don t know what ejaculation feels like don t worry you ll know it when it happens If you want to know how sperm is supposed to look like fresh out of the penis break and egg in a bowl and look at the transparent liquid Imagine this but white Now sperm is going to be sticky smells surprisingly like cleaning chemicals and taste like bugger don t ask how I know the last one and don t attempt to taste it And that s it Now go on and masturbate,Miscellaneous,"Miscellaneous, Positive Coping, Seeking Help"

Day Hey Sorry I was delayed with Day update but I was really out of it today and pretty much stayed in bed as much as possible all day I decided on this update I should probably give some back story about me so you can get a better understanding as to why Im here where I am now Im a yr old female and come from a pretty rough childhood I was molested abused both physically and verbally by relatives and grew up with no money in our household My mum was an alcoholic from pretty much as far as I can remember and my Dad left us when I was Because of Mums alcohol abuse I was the primary care giver for my two younger brothers Im the second oldest but our older brother is years older than me so he moved away from this fucked up family as soon as he could and I was left to care for my Mum and brothers We had to live with my Grandpa when I was because he was getting too old to care for himself yet somehow he had the energy to beat me and kill my cat in front of me when he got angry It was always me who was the target My brothers were treated like royalty and I was treated like scum But I tried my best to keep pushing I made sure my brothers got to school okay I tried to go to school when i could which wasnt very often because Mum was always so drugged up on anything she could get her hands on I was scared she d die in her sleep She slept all day and all night and only got up for like an hour or two in the evening to give us a can of spaghetti to share between the three of us and wine for herself This when on till I was about or I was beaten by my Pa every day always starving and making sure Mum didnt die in her sleep One day she went missing for over a week and while she was gone and my brothers and I were taken from our home into emergency foster care I assumed the school and neighbours notified the authorities about us being alone with our Pa because of how abusive he was Anyway we were there for two weeks before they found our Mum at some randoms dudes place all beaten and drugged up We had to go see her in hospital and it was pretty scary Ive never seen someone so yellow before I didnt know skin could be that colour Skip a few years and we are still in foster care and Im trying to get my life together I start going back to school even though I wasnt welcome there by teachers or students I got bullied by both all the time and it pretty awful I think the worst time was when I was trying to eat my lunch a block or two away from the school because I was too scared to be near people but some boys stalked me and beat me They kicked me in the chest and it was so hard to breathe and when I told the teachers they told me I shouldnt of been off school property Well fuck my bad Anyway when I was our government case worker found my Dad in another state and sent my younger brothers and I to live with him his new wife and two little girls I was pretty happy to finally feel like maybe I had a second chance at family but that didnt turn out so well In my short months of living there I was beaten by my step mum bullied even worse at my new school and was on watch by my parents because for some reason I was the devils child and couldnt be trusted This was about the time a girl I knew at school who I sorta considered to be my first friend told me that her boyfriend was cutting himself and she showed me pictures I asked her how he did it and she told me he could get razors out of pencil sharpeners That thought really scared me and I found it pretty gross A few weeks pass and my step mother was yelling at me because Im just like my mother and Im useless to everyone and I thought about the self harming my friend told me When she left the room I sat on my couch and cried for hours frantically trying to get this razor out of a pencil sharpener and I didnt know how It really infuriated me so i stomped on it till i got it out I dont know what came over me but I just started cutting All down my thighs and my right wrist I stopped when I realised that if anyone found out then I could be in more trouble A few days go by and im doing the night dishes and my step mother bursts into the kitchen and starts grilling me about not using colour coated pegs to hang the washing yeah she was OCD as fuck and I got really angry and waved my arms at her and told her she s nuts This revealed my cutting on my wrists though and when she noticed them she immediately grabbed my arm that was covered in cuts and dragged me to see my father They both started telling me that it was unacceptable and theyre both extremely disappointed in me I got my phone taken away for months and no computer use for a year I went back into my room and just sobbed my eyes out Thankfully through the government system I was seeing a counsellor and I told her what had happened and the next day I was out of my Dads care I had a boyfriend at the time who i only just met but his Mum was nice enough to let me stay with her till I got my own place My two brothers stayed in my Dads care for a while but were sent back to the state we originally came from because they didnt want them anymore I stayed with my boyfriends mum for about a year till I was and could live in student accommodation for school My schooling never really improved and I was diagnosed with depression and social anxiety during this time and kept to myself a lot It wasnt until I was that I sort of made a couple of friends through my boyfriend and school that I felt a little happier However my boyfriend cheated on me after a couple of years of dating and that put me into a whole new hole of depression I started self harming again and drank every cheap night I could out in town and slept with pretty much anyone because I wanted to feel wanted by someone Even if it was for a night I wanted to feel like I was something to someone This went on till I was with a couple of boyfriends in between and I left school to find a job and also I moved into a shared home to make it easier to start saving and have more money to buy things I wanted I also adopted a cat during this time and was actually pretty happy Unfortunately i had little contact with my brothers and foster carers but I was getting my life on track and it was good I was working two jobs at one point in a restaurant and a nightclub I really loved it One night at the night club a man asked for my number since it was his st birthday and I dont believe in love at first sight but I just knew he was the one for me I gave him my number and we instantly fell in love I could write forever about how much I adore this man but Ive already said so much and Im sure no one has read this far anyway But I loved him so much I saw our entire future together and I didnt see myself alive past but with him I saw forever We saw each other every weekend and went through a lot of anazing times togethers but like all relationships we had our rough patches He had severe anxiety and I thought I was over mine so I gave him my all to get him the support he needed to get through his but he was stuck in his own dark cloud of anxiety and nothing could get him out of it We dated for almost a year but that last few months were torture He was so depressed but not suicidal thankfully and always so anxious I gave him anything he needed or wanted and I forgot to take care of myself My depression was creeping back and my anxiety flared up whenever we were together We decided it was best we went our own ways to get ourselves back to who we once were when we first fell in love I dont deny we are out of love now but we dont speak as often as we use to and its still hard to see him pop up on my newsfeed every now and then After that my depression was creeping anymore and it crashed on me like a tonne of bricks My anxiety turned into full on panic attacks and I started feeling extremely suicidal One night I was just at home distracting myself with a video game and my roommate forced himself into my room and started yelling at me for something I dont remember what it was but next thing I know I was running down the street and I ran for about or kms till I came to a bridge This bridge was over water and i stared at it sobbing from the bottom of the walk way It was like am and for some reason I couldnt control my own body or mind I climbed to the highest point of the bridge and called my recent ex boyfriend but he didnt answer I tried to call him times before I gave up and sent him a really long message about how much I love him and not to blame himself for what Im about to do He didnt respond and I remember taking my shoes off turning off my phone and putting into my left shoe and my wallet into my right shoe I climed over the railing and I suddenly felt happiness I laughed so much and could feel the cold wind against my fingers and toes and just felt relieved I knew I was going to die and I was happy But someone who I guess was a late night runner grabbed me under my arms and used all his strength to slide me back over the railing It hurt like hell i thought my back was going to break Next thing I know I woke up in hospital and I was scared I was in a huge as fuck room with just cold toast and juice beside me and my belongings next to them I grabbed my phone and had a text from my ex He told me the hospital tried to contact him because he was my only emergency contact but ge couldnt see me in hospital because it would crush him to see me how I was I begged him to come but he wouldnt No one came No one from work called to see if I was okay or my housemates I had to stay there for two weeks and it was fucking boring and scary at times Thankfully I knew one of the guards there who I use to work with at the nightclub and he kept me company and snuck in food and gifts from outside We still keep in contact now but its hard to organise to see each other since we live in seperate states While I was in hospital I organised to move away I decided it was time for a change and away from this place so two days out of hospital I had everything organised and moved to another state A guy i met through playing games gave me his couch to crash on till I could find work and my own place It wasnt long till things went sour I told no one I moved away and when people found out they were pretty pissed and dont talk to me now and if they do its because its a pity check up The guy i was living with raped me and said I owed him this because I was staying at his house free of charge It took a long time to find a job and i found one in a cafe close by but as soon as I was alone I left that house and was homeless for a couple of days till I found a shared rental with some really nice people But my job was now two hours away and only casual so it wasnt worth the trams and buses for maybe a shift or two a week So i quit and lived off government payments I also broke my arm as well so finding work was really hard I also got back in touch with Mum because we were in the same state and I was hoping she was doing okay She wasnt but she was trying to get better so I offered to help She informed me by Pa had died thankfully and she was waiting on his inheritance so she could start her life fresh and I was pretty proud of that She needed a change as much as me and even though she was a pretty crap Mum when I was younger I wanted to give her a second chance When my arm was better I scored a job in a call centre that Im still doing now and its really stressful but Im not face to face with customers and that makes me pretty happy My mum got her inheritance and offered me grand to help set me up in my own rental so I dont have to couch surf anymore I declinded every time she offered because Im really independent abnd hate hand outs but she insisted for a couple of months so I said yes and got myself set up in my own place Things were looking up My depression was still there but I was distracting myself with work and started seeing someone as well But my ex kept coming back into the picture saying how sorry he was and wanted to see me and all this crap and I fell for it but it did more harm to my mental health than good so I had to tell him I need to be alone Anyway my Mum insisted she d buy all my things and not worry about paying her back but I told her not to spend grand on me since I want to pay her back abd I only need the essentials like a fridge bed washing machine and kitchen utensils She agreed but a few weeks later when it all arrived at my house it was more than I asked for I told mum I dont need all this stuff and I cant afford to pay her back for this She insisted not to worry about it and just be a lady and get yourself set up I was really happy I finally had my own space and work was a good distraction and Mum was back in my life but coming to the last few months it has been hell Mum decided to sue me for all things she bought me because I havent paid her back yet and when I told her what I could afford to give her out of my budget that wasnt good enough so she told me I should kill myself and I wont be missed and she ll see me in court My work started cracking down on us and it was flaring up my anxiety my ex was still trying to be apart of my life and it was really hard to maintain friends here and also make new ones I was slowly becoming in debt due to my phone bill and my internet provider screwed me over too Financially Im not doing good at all Im constantly eating bad and my nice body I had before is turning into mush My boyfriend was complaining we arent having enough sex because Im too overwhelmed all the time and I was becoming distant I was also diagnosed with borderline personality disorder this year and that stresses me out a tonne So one day I just snapped My life isnt getting better in fact its getting worse and this is when the attempt came into place a couple of weeks ago If youre exhausted from reading all this then thats just about as exhausted I am all the time My life was a mess and no matter how much I try to turn it into good I get screwed over Some of you know I have a dog Eva I adopted her a few weeks prior to be in my loving animal family but shes extremely active and my depression over this last year hasnt been good for her or my home so I gave her to a friend at work and shes doing well Anyway I snapped I broke up with the guy i was seeing i deactivated my social medias and downed mg of valium and some alcohol I gave my cat a kiss and cuddle and let her outside and Eva stayed right by my side as I fell asleep on her tummy What I forgot until the next day is that when I was taking all the drugs I told a close friend at work what I was doing and he came over and saved me Im not sure why I told him but he said I wasnt making sense on the phone and I just fell asleep and knew something was wrong I woke up in his house all sweaty and my stomach was so sore Eva was at the end of the bed and he was in a chair beside the bed He told me everything that had happened and I apparently begged him not to take me to the hospital and so he just kept an eye on me instead During the last couple of weeks Ive been using my savings to a things Ive never done before before I try to kill myself again I told work I needed time off and went to a state ive been to a few times and saw a girlfriend I knew and had an amazing time with her I told her everything I did and she was happy I was trying to do nice things for myself to see that my life was worth living for I also saw my favourite band play live which was so fucking amazing I never felt so pumped about anything in my life before like that gig Ive upgraded my PC so its amazing now and Im going to give to a guy at work who loves gaming but needs a new PC and Ive given a lot of my savings to friends for christmas gifts I even gave my landlord some candles and chocolate Im really going to go ahead and do this again Im at peace After my pill o d attempt I didnt regret it and I wish it worked Im trying to go back to work so I can have a little extra money to send my brothers before I go and to the guy at work who was with me the night I o d Im not sure how long until I do this again but I know Ill be gone by the new year Anyway if youre still here reading then good on you You deserve a medal Day will be a lot shorter and will be exactly about my day Im going to go to work tomorrow I think and hope I last the whole day Good vibes you guys,"Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Positive Coping, Seeking Help, Progress Update, Mood Tracking, Cause of

Waking up in the middle of the night weighing up the pros and cons of people caring that I stay alive It s currently Monday morning AM I woke up about two hours ago still half drunk having had about hours sleep ate some more Xanax and smoked more weed I spent most of this weekend in my bed I wanted to go out and do things but one way or another I seemed to convince myself not to I have a good support network which I m extremely grateful The feeling that I have let my family and loved ones down has been fundamental in the way that I have viewed every day since I was or I m now M Significant mental health issues and substance abuse have been ongoing problems for me since then In this time I have continued to meet a few amazing people who have challenged my cynicism about humanity This adds to my conflict Do I want to be here Is me being here of enough benefit to be worth it My dreams and goals are barely worth mentioning anymore because my work towards achieving them has completely stagnated I am no longer sure if I am capable of ever completing my university degree and making the world a slightly better place through my career During the pandemic and recession the government in my country has been providing financial assistance to people who lost their jobs due to the economic circumstances I am one of these people I am very grateful for what has been provided to me but the government money provided to us is about to be reduced and sustaining myself is about to become more difficult unless I can manage to find a new job amp x B Right now I kind of just wish I hadn t woken up in the middle of the night I feel slightly better after crying and writing this but I suspect that this loneliness is about become quite overwhelming again when I finish writing Love of any kind seems to so rarely be a worthwhile investment Is it normal that most of the people who I have loved have either severely betrayed me left or died I know that I m the common link here I know that I get along well with mentally ill people because I m mentally ill but how the fuck do I fix all this I couldn t deal with another loved one dying from drug alcohol overdose or suicide I can t count them on both hands anymore I know there are people in much worse positions but I can t talk to anyone about this stuff and I feel so alone Today was a nice day why am I still like this It s almost am now I wonder if I ll be able to go back to sleep,"Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Progress Update, Mood Tracking, Cause of Distress","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Maladaptive Coping, Mental Distress, Mood Tracking, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

That‚Äö√Ñ√¥s all my friends,"Positive Coping, Mood Tracking, Cause of Distress",Miscellaneous
"Ok I'm a 22 year old guy. In 2014 I began to improve my diet. I just stopped eating junkfood, sugar, no sodas, and just water and 3 solid meals a day. Eventually a few weeks after that I felt like a god like I woke up for the first time. Before this my mood was worse and so was my diet. Anyway my libido was never better, I lost fat, physical strength seemed to increase, mood very balanced and energy was great! I wasn't even workingout then. Even on days were I didn't sleep to good I still felt phenomenal. I enjoyed doing things in the yard and my irritablility was nonexistent, but occasionlly I'd eat sugar, or drink a beer here and there but thats it. This lasted to about thanksgiving last year. I lost selfcontrol and fell a slave to the holiday foods. Especially Christmas. So yeah I picked up pounds and my libido decreased and my energy but my mood was decent still. This last till about early March this year. So last month I cleaned my diet up or tried to. Heres the thing, I just got a job in March and pretty much I leave early in the morning and come back late at night, and I have to repeat next morning. I wasn't able eat too much. I still ate 3 times a day but I didnt have time to eat a large amount. Ever since then, my mood has shot down, my libido has gone down, now I'm irrationally angry and depressed for no reason! Homicidal thoughts and occasionally suicidal. Like I wanted to drive this lady of the road this morning for cutting me off and flipping me off and I didn't even care she had a kid with her, but luckily I maintained control and I got over it quickly. My mood bounces like crazy, I can be happy talking with a friend and then after they leave hours later, I'm depressed, then I'm wanting to kill someone, then I see something funny or distracting that puts me in a temporarily good mood. I already had an episode of me yelling outside earlier because I didn't want to break anything in my home. Last week I wanted to attack some guy just from snoring on the bus, this is a new type of anger for me. My muscle mass has decreased, I feel a bit weaker, somedays or moments I feel lethargic, hating life and fatigue others I don't, even if I sleep good I'll still feel tired even if I wake up with a good mood. I do notice I get a temporary mood boost while and after I'm eating but feel fatigued sometime after. I was thinking maybe I wasn't eating enough because I know restricting calories can cause a few issues. I changed jobs, now I'm working with my uncle who has a much better work schedule. I'm putting a bit more food on my plate thinking I'd go back to my old self, but no help at all. I don't know if I'm still not eating enough, I did increase the amount of food though. I'm not sure if this is a mental issue or a nutritional one. I'm not going through anything that would cause me to be this angry for no reason. Nothing in my life has changed except my eating habit which I'm fixing. I'm sleeping way better, and again no junk or sugar. Even years ago when I ate like crap, I never experienced this. If this not a lack of calorie issue, then WHY now? Why all of a sudden do I feel a drop in everything, I mean back in 2014 I fixed my diet felt fantastic, I get a little loose with it, try to fix it again now this is happening. I'm confused. From what I remember, I don't think I'm eating much less than I was last year, also I'm less social, like I'd rather stay in than hangout. I never was a huge social person but I still enjoyed the occasional outing. Sorry if this is long, again I'm just extremely lost here and confused as to what the source of this could be. Could being overweight cause this?? I've been obese before and it's not a thing new to me.

There s a bridge near my new house On Tuesday morning I woke up feeling exhausted My head was pounding with a headache my nose snuffed up my shoulders hurt my chest was tight my back was aching I cried I cried hard I cried about the rash consuming my legs I cried about how I have little meaningful relationships I cried about how I assume people think of me I cried about my job And my living situation I cried about being different I pulled myself together for a moment and decided to go to a walk in clinic Something I ve been putting off for months I went downstairs and jumped in the shower And I sobbed while washing my hair And screamed and yelled at myself and the world not through anger or hate but because of my inability to change or more so the self sabotage that I routinely commit I dried off avoiding my reflection in the mirror I microwaved some chicken fingers and drank a bottle of water I watched a YouTube video about a board game And then I cried some more I called the local mental health crisis centre where I ve dragged myself to in the past because they ve called me twice in two weeks and I haven t returned either of their calls I scheduled a meeting with a counsellor for two weeks from now knowing damn well I might not make it that far I don t have a doctor but I know what I do have and undiagnosed mental illness Or I m looking for a crutch Something to label myself so I know it s not my fault for putting myself in the positions I do At this point I was dressed and ready to leave my house I put on my sunglasses and headed out but I didn t head toward the busy main street or the clinic I started off toward the bridge A pedestrian bridge towering above jagged rocks and a river with an unforgiving current I walked slowly and confidently down the street toward the park housing the bridge My mind ablaze with the thoughts of ending it The image of myself laying upon the rocks for hours My lungs filling with blood Cold Scared But I turned at the last second Left instead of right And just walked for hours I walked until the road ended and I was exhausted Then I walked back on the busy main street Watching the people going on with their days Only stopping the get a pack of cigarettes which I had quit two months prior and a coffee And then I went home The thoughts are still there but I have them in check again To die another day,"Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Mood Tracking, Cause of Distress","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Maladaptive Coping, Mental Distress, Mood Tracking, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

Getting Worse Deteriorating Self WorthWas at the coffee shop several days ago that I go to so I can get out of the house and talked with a girl working at the counter She had heard from one of the other workers that I liked to draw and asked if I could draw I smiled and said yes She asked me if I could paint and I said that I could Nothing fancy of course I told her about how I ve been wanting to go to a place nearby where they have paint supplies to use there but I didn t want to go alone This girl responded with I d love to go I was in shock when I heard this as I m in my early s and have been rejected by girls since I first tried at I ve always been socially awkward and have just gotten more that way over the years from bullying and harassment I told her I was surprised by her response and how the previous girl I asked to go out there thought I was asking for sex and humiliated me in front of everyone in the store She gave a sad aww why and I told her I had no idea She asked when I wanted to go and I told her that my schedule is usually free so whatever time is convenient for her She said she would be happy to go at the first convenient time for her I was actually feeling somewhat happy just knowing I d be able to go out with someone and do something fun I told her she could have my number and just call me whenever she thought was a good time and proceeded to give her my number My anxiety since then has been really high consistently Fast forward a few days and I hadn t received any call or text so when I finally met her at the coffee shop again I asked her if she still wanted to go paint She told me she wrote my number down and misplaced it only to find it in her work attire She sent me a text to confirm the number and I added her to my contacts That girl motivated me to do more art in the coffee shop but my depression and anxiety constantly surround me days would go by until I gave in and tried to lightly bring up the subject of whether she had any idea when would be convenient for her Her response was I ve been really busy I broke down several days later and sent her a text saying that I was feeling really miserable and needed someone to talk to I thought for sure she was going to get irritated with me and finally just stop talking to me Her response was one of the kindest I ve ever had from anyone more so from a girl She offered to sit with me and talk after they closed the shop and she was definitely wanting to go paint with me I sent a few more texts about how miserable I ve felt just being stuck in my head and how I couldn t believe the kindness she was showing me compared to anyone in this life She shared her own experiences and I could actually relate to her At this point I started to fall more in love I guess At the end of the night we sat outside and talked I almost started crying while talking to her because the more she shared the more I could relate until another worker who I think was making fun of me for the previous incident with the other girl pulled up to us on his motorcycle and asked if we wanted to go to the nearby diner and maybe eat something I had to use the restroom so I gave in and said yes jokingly saying that if they have a restroom then sure I try as hard as I can to minimize showing any kind of problems going on with me just to avoid the anger I have from setting off stupid aggressive people We get up and meet at the diner where it s now of us including another worker and suddenly the one on one talk with the girl turned into a fucking group therapy session where the other two blatantly stated they ve never experienced the hardships I ve had to go through and shared their own stories I could see everyone was beginning to get progressively more depressed as I shared I couldn t bring myself to share everything I wanted to with the girl just to connect with her I wanted to so much but there I was locked in my fucking head fighting anger and sadness from overwhelming everyone It was about in the morning when we finally got up the guy on the motorcycle said he would be at the coffee shop to hear the rest of my story We had a small talk outside of the diner and since it was cold the girl was shivering and that one other guy not in a relationship with her opened his arms and held the girl to keep her warm I looked away and stared at the guy on the motorcycle while he talked but I couldn t get that out of my head even as it continued for a minute When I got back to the car I put my head down wanting to just disappear My anger and sadness was overwhelming partly from being unable to have a one on one connection with that girl and her hugging the guy was burned into my mind which brought more shit from my past flooding forward When I got home I sent her a message saying I shouldn t have agreed to that group sitting that it was extremely painful for me The next day when I went to draw at the coffee shop that guy with the motorcycle never showed up I could barely look the girl in the face and I sent more texts about how miserable I felt but there was no response until closer to the end of the day My depression from opening up was getting extremely bad Once again the responses she had were some of the kindest responses I ve ever received When I got home I had more conversation with her and I broke down because of her kind responses and her struggles in life were relatable Her kindness had brought my depression down and done more than any doctors or medications were ever able to I told her you helped me so I m going to help you I offered to help her pay the rent as a thank you for being so damn kind and bring me back from a bad place She refused and told me she was trying not to cry after hearing that and seeing the money At this point was extremely embarrassed standing there around other patrons and some of the other works I didn t think she understood how much she just helped me perhaps saved me so I insisted and she refused again So partly in anger I left the money on the counter of the coffee shop telling her that someone was going to take it if she didn t I was fully intending to do that because her helped meant the world to me and I refused to take it back but she came up to me with the money and told me she hadn t earned it and refused to accept it My response was how she had done more than any doctors or meds had ever done before I finally gave in and took the money back I got to my car and sent her a message that it wasn t fair how I felt useless when she refused my help I felt even more miserable on my way home I think I probably freaked her out after that incident I sent more texts trying to talk to her wanting to just be with someone somewhere NOT STUCK IN MY FUCKING HEAD Either that night or the next I left the house She had stopped responding to my texts Sent multiple texts describing how I had no idea where my life was going I told her I wanted to leave and sit somewhere to watch the sun rise I didn t want to be alone I was fucking tired of constantly being stuck in my head I wanted to tell her that I wanted to be with her more than anything All I could muster was just statements of loneliness What transpired after was me driving in the night until the sun started coming up I took some pictures of the sunrise and sent them to her with the message Even though you didn t accept the money please accept this sunrise as my thank you I was so exhausted for the rest of my trip back home from being awake all night I sent one last message saying I was going to fall asleep and hoped that her day turned out to be great There hadn t been any responses for the past day something she never let drag on and I figured at this point she either got tired of reading my shit or was simply busy as she repeatedly implied when I asked about going to paint Regardless I felt an overwhelming love for this girl and as I fell asleep I actually was able to drift off without too much trouble When I woke up several hours later today there was still no response since the night before I decided to not brood over negative possibilities and just go draw something at the coffee shop and try to relax as best I could with this depression constantly there I got to the coffee shop and the girl was there she asked me if I d gotten some rest which implied that she had read everything I sent Further more she said nothing about the sun rise photos that I sent her All she mentioned was me getting some rest I put so much effort into getting the photos of that sunrise there was a drunk in front of me at one point swerving into oncoming traffic Depression kicked in heavily and I ordered something before sitting down and drawing trying to tune out everything around me The two guys that joined us at the diner were working there today as well Through out the day I could hear the of them laughing and picked out several comments making fun of me I removed the girl from my contacts so she wouldn t have to see any more depressing things from me and I m sure there s not going to be any painting with someone else I felt myself shrinking further and further inwards Smaller smaller smaller nothing just not wanting to be here anymore I wrote in my sketchpad You asked me if I got rest that told me you read the messages I had to piece two and two together that I was talking to myself I removed you from my contacts so you don t have to read my stuff any more I thought the sunrise photos were nice If you care please speak to me in person Show me through your actions I let you in Invite me out ask me to hang out show me you care I want to cry right now but I feel a painful emptiness inside no tears just sadness Tired and sick,"Critical Risk, Mental

I don t know how to dream anymore and I want to give upI don t know what happened but around the time I was something clicked in me Within a day I completely lost my ability to dream about a future I stopped trying in school I lost normal habits showering regularly cleaning my room brushing my teeth and lost all responsibility under the impression I was never going to grow up so there s no use keeping those habits Now I m and I completely fucked myself over I don t have any social skills don t have a job fuck I barely even have teeth anymore because I haven t brushed them in so long half of them are broken or corroded No matter how much I tell myself I want and need to get help I know I ll never be able to push myself to get the help I need Everything became so much worse when last year I ignored a friend who desperately wanted and needed help because I felt too awkward around someone who was just as depressed as I am and they ended up killing themselves which I ve blamed myself for for days straight and now I straight up hate the one person who was there for me through it all All I can do is distract myself from the bad thoughts by watching videos and playing video games I even force myself to take large doses of sleeping pills to the point where I can t even feel my own face because if I m left alone with my thoughts sober I start to convince myself that it isn t worth it anymore I know this is all taking a huge toll on my mother because she s forced to support me through all of this but whenever I consider if I should at least get a job I worry the added pressure will just push me over the edge I don t remember what happened to me when I suddenly changed like that but whatever it was took away my ability to dream took away my drive for living and all my passions and I just wish I could go back in time and prevent it from ever happening,"Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Mood Tracking, Cause of Distress","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Maladaptive Coping, Mental Distress, Mood Tracking, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

Could anyone give me advice I ve had psychological problems for as long as I can remember and I ve reached out for help so many times but no matter what I do nothing changes The first few times I asked for help I told my parent I was depressed This was when I was barely a teenager and she just did the normal parent thing of saying What do you have to be depressed about Then a few years later I started self harming and not attending school My school made me see a psychologist for low attendance but they said I was fine My Mother told them about my self harming which I m sure they already knew about if and this psychologist said it s just trendy and that her son does it because he s a Goth Those words makes me cringe to this day My Mother took me to my GP anyway and they refused me to refer me to any mental health service and gave me a leaflet for a mental health service of which I was not within the age range I later dropped out of school I started drinking to deal with it then having strange symptoms derealisation depersonalisation I was having panic attacks multiple times everyday and completely socially isolates myself for a few years I felt terrible all the time and was deeply disturbed by my thoughts When things got a little better I decided to go back to school as I had no qualifications and went on to study a course which could get me into University studying a science related degree I found the work stupidly easy and went through with good grades By the time I was on my last year my mental health was deteriorating quickly I could no longer concentrate or function at school or in any other area of my life I went to my GP and they asked me some irrelevant questions about my Father none about my symptoms apart from weight loss gain and sleep Then refused to give me SSRI s I went home and some time later my memory is a blur I tried to kill myself I ve now had two serious attempts at taking my life and I m positive there s no way for me to get help but if I don t get help soon I know I m going to try again And I know it will likely work this time I ve tried to get help so many times I can t even leave my house anymore I don t know what to do Nobody is taking me seriously and I have no idea what s wrong with me How can I get help I ve even tried reaching out to people working in the NHS Nothing comes of it I have people who depend on me and I don t want to put my potential to waste but I m running out of time and I ve tried everything I can I don t even have the emotional energy anymore I m not scared of dying and the idea is quite appealing to me regardless of my mental state so if it happens it happens I have multiple mental health problems as well as sensory processing problems relating to a neurodevelopment disorder I have and just existing is torture to me Even when my mental health is okay I want the suffering to end I m so so tired I just need to know that I tried for the people I care about and my own philosophical reasons And I would do anything in my power to turn this situation around If anyone can offer any advice to me then please leave a comment Anything you have to say will be helpful to me,"Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Positive Coping, Seeking Help, Progress Update, Mood Tracking, Cause of Distress","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Maladaptive Coping, Mental Distress, Mood Tracking, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

I can t tell anyone the real reason I m suicidal I was recently put in a psych ward for the suicidal because I was stupidly dropping major hints that I planned to kill my self in hopes that I could ask for help without destroying my pride When I was put in there my family blamed it on Prozac seeing as one of its side effects is suicidal thoughts I ve talked to therapist after therapist and I told them all the same thing But I haven t told anyone why I really wanted to kill myself Not even my closest friends The real reason I wanted to die was because of a girl I know it sounds stupid but hear me out I had known this girl for years and have had a HUGE crush on her from the second I was introduced to her Many years went by she had moved back and forth a few times When she came back this time I confessed my feelings for her She said the feelings were mutual but she wasn t ready for a relationship yet seeing as she had just gotten out of a bad relationship I made sure to let her know that I understood and planned to respect that About a month goes by and she is very flirty with me Touching me writing me little notes making fun of eachother sending me hearts etc However just when I think I m getting somewhere she gets back together with her ex They were all over eachother Their social media s filled with posts about eachother and going on and on about eachother The works Now not only was I fucked sideways in this situation but she still keeps me just close enough so that these feelings can t go away And she still does all the flirty things she did when she was single She is the only girl I ve ever had feelings this strong for I can t help but love her But after a month and a half of this It didn t sting as bad it just made me very depressed and sick I was starting to get over my suicidal feelings The psych ward really helped me realize a lot However all of those feelings rushed back after we hung out We grabbed a pizza watched a movie made eachother laugh and went for a walk in the autumn leaves She looked absolutely amazing She made me happy The entire time I was with her I didn t have a single worry Nothing else mattered It felt like I was in heaven It was then I realized how much I actually love her She told me she loved me but it felt so hollow as if it barely meant anything to her I just felt so empty knowing how disposable I am We talk often and she says she considers me her best friend I obviously play along but she means far more to me than any friend ever has We talk almost every day we hangout at least once a week and she still acts as flirty as she used to but I know it ll never go anywhere It s sad to say but I put all my eggs in one basket and somebody stole it I know I sound really pathetic but that s why I lied to everyone I m ashamed that she is the reason I wanted to end my life Don t get it wrong I have a life outside of her I have friends and family and hobbies and things to be proud of but it feels like none of that matters without her I m truly a piece of shit but I guess that s why I m saying this to strangers on the internet,"Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Seeking Help, Progress Update, Mood Tracking, Cause of Distress","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Maladaptive Coping, Mental Distress, Mood Tracking, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

If you were would you want to live If you were me Ok I m I used to study medicine but that didn t work out Then I got a job in the city which I loved and a few months later everything changed I was Basically I started hearing a voice never did drugs or anything and I had this voice control me ever since I know it sounds like a bad movie but this voice can control everything I do and say It made me lose my job It stopped me going to the gym and being healthy It makes me smoke every day It doesn t let me get another job or talk to a girl or exercise My life is watching tv twitter reddit all night until am in the morning Then waking up at pm and going out to get a coffee alone Then watching t v again until am the next day Medication has been tried and doesn t help I saw a psychologist but I guess it was too much for her because she said she wasn t experienced enough lol So imagine right now you can no longer work be in love you have to smoke which you don t want to and you can t exercise Your life is tv It s like a prison Would you want to live like that It s not enough for me I have a loving family and a couple of friends but it s just not enough I want a job and my own place and love but I will never have it because this voice won t let me Btw thankfully this voice has never made me do anything illegal or dangerous,"Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Progress Update, Mood Tracking, Cause of Distress","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Maladaptive Coping, Mental Distress, Mood Tracking, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

I am tired I am tired of trying TLDR I hate myself Trauma Depression Bipolar Anxiety I want to kill myself but I can t bring myself to do it I ll start off by saying that I most likely delete this post sometime after posting it I guess I just need to get some stuff out I am years old I m working full time in a career that I worked very hard for A job which brings me much financial security and in some ways brings me some semblance of fulfillment I have an amazing boyfriend who loves me and wants to marry me I have a few good friends I have access to mental health care and support But I still want to die As a kid I grew up in a family of alcoholics and drug users My dad died when I was years old and I grew up with many of my most fond memories of him being drunk and trying to break into the house he broke into the house twice actually My uncle then died of drug and alcohol use On top of that my mom was also an alcoholic and I suffered through years of psychological mental and verbal abuse I frequently have recall memories of my mom yelling at me about how fucked up I was Or how I was fat and ugly Or how I was a bitch Or how I was a slut I was gaslit I was made to believe for a long time that my life with my mom was perfect and I was the one making things difficult by being a drama queen My mom rarely let me leave the house aside from school or going to the grocery store Her being a protective parent did not allow people to pick me up friends or parents so I spent much of my time alone on the weekends and during summer For a long time my mom was one of the few people I hung out with and really she was my best and only friend for years she was my entire life I had no one else It was use against the world During my teenage years I began to show signs of anxiety depression and bipolar looking back on it I can see where I showed signs of bipolar disorder but I was never diagnosed I began self harming and thought of killing myself I would take copious amounts of sleeping pills to sleep and be in a fog during my school days A few times I took more than pills in an attempt to kill myself obviously it did not work High school was some of the worst years of my life I did not think I would make it to the age of years old Now I m I hate my job the job I was supposed to love so much My job brings so much stress and anxiety I no longer see why I went into the field My administration make me want to scream They make my life worse My job makes my life worse I wake up every morning dreading that I have to work My boyfriend is great but I know he deserves so much better Who wants to be with someone as fucked as me Who has baggage like I do My past affects me so deeply and affects my behavior which affects him I have few friends I feel like I am living for my boyfriend but like I said he deserves so much more I want to be everything for him but I do not know if I ever will be I feel guilty because I do have a good life but I still want to die I want to die I want to stop hearing my mom s voice in my head I want to stop being a burden to everyone I want to cease to exist and I want everyone who loves me to move on and find other better people to fill my space in their lives someone more deserving of that space I m struggling with the fact that I made it to my th year it feels so weird to have made it when I thought I would be dead by It s jarring to say the least I don t know how I am supposed to make it any further The future seems so dark and bleak Honestly I don t even see a future for myself I don t deserve to live I am a burden on this earth I just need the courage to do it I apologize to anyone if this post seems rambling I just needed to get this out,"Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Positive Coping, Seeking Help, Progress Update, Mood Tracking, Cause of Distress","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Maladaptive Coping, Mental Distress, Mood Tracking, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

One last shot before i make the final decisionM throwaway for obvious reasons amp x B After spending several months deperately trying to find a plan or another way out of this mess i haven t come up with a single viable solution so i will try to post this somewhere for someone to read maybe even care Story Suicide and depression have always been in my blood my father hanged himself when i was just and my big brother jumped in front of a train when i was It s important for me to say that i have had a good life my youth was not a place of depression or despair at all I had friends girls and i did really well in high school despite almost no attempt I had a quirk however that still destroys me to this day i have this tendency to push people away in a very dramatic way when they get to close That naturally do mean that i speak to noone from my high school days or even before the majority have explicit hate towards me Anyway the story of how i am where i am today During studying for my B Sc https B sc i got a relevant part time job on the side and i absolutely hated every minute of it I made the choice to finish my degree and basicly take extra cources regarding topics that cought my interest and i could ses myself pursueing a career in Since my B Sc https B Sc is in economics and business administration i had the opportunity to influence it to a certain degree Fast forward to when i completed my B Sc https B Sc I was incredibly lucky to get enrolled into exactly the master s degree i had intented on top of that i met the girl of my dreams Everything was lining up perfectly and the plan was made Study like a madman spend time with the girl and apply for relevant part time jobs or internships rince and repeat every day And i did However my grades were going down the drain and despite several interviews i did not get any job months into my Masters my self esteem is non existent and its taking a toll on my relationsship Since my GF would never even think of leaving me at the time she was always a bubbly person and her life was progressing quickly for the better she put things on hold to help me get up again This were something i could not live with i have no intention of holding anyone back or make their life a compromise so i decided to leave her I still remember the last thing i said to her at the time This is the biggest mistake i have ever made in my life Fast forward months things are going even worse i completely realize that soon have a close to worthless degree and cant get a job and i am ashamed to even see my friends who s lifes are lining up perfectly However one day a hear a silent knock on my front door Its my now Ex girlfriend with tears in her eyes she tells me she loves me and i am the only one she ever wants to be with i tell her i love her first time i ever told anyone We get back together The next months are horrible i start seing a psychotherapist without my girl knowing I am diagnosed with depression anxiety and sleep deprivation I get medication for all of it For some reason every second is pure agony to me and i eventually plan my own suicide January By November I decide to leave my now ex girl to lessen the blow of me passing away Going all november and december planning my suicide while doing my exams I somehow decide the give life another chance It s hard to explain but people around you can sense when you doing horrible i got random message from friends telling me i was a good guy and other encouriging words out of the blue despite no one knowing of my condition New years eve i get a long text from my ex girlfriend that she loved me she will never forget me that we might me some where down the line in a better place One week after i decide to go to her place just the way she did for me in hopes of a sweet reunion However things go really dark She is home with another guy She s angry at me she s says she hates me She tells me that she called the cops Right after she deletes and blocks me from any form of contact and social media One month later she s engaged to this succesful rich and handsome guy seemingly as happy as she wll ever be She loved me until she found something better The months after are tough i plan another date for my suicide July I continue to write my masters thesis and try to meet new people I just delivered my master thesis its horrible final nail in the coffin for my GPA I managed to get no part time jobs or internships despite applications during my studies I have applied for close to full time jobs the last months No interviews The girl of my dreams are getting married to a guy who is everything i tried to be but could not By October i will be out on the streets with nothing but debt My friends are doing well and i am ashamed to see them I once heard someone say that suicide is only a viable option when there is no hope for a better future I believe there isn t Even if i get a job to scrape by I will have to live a miserable lonely live because of the decisions i made I dont believe i can I still want to emphasize that i have had a good life However i do not believe there are any more happy moments for me Spoiled i know Sorry for not so well written english and the wall of text I expect nothing but it certaintly does not hurt to write it out,"Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Progress Update, Mood Tracking, Cause of Distress","Cause

Inevitable Turning in hrs I completely wasted my s by adapting the hermit lifestyle I stayed at home playing video games watching anime or wasting hours on end living in an MMO I think the major turning point was at or I found out that my fiance was cheating on me Not just in the normal way but picture this Imagine finding out that the wedding that your fiance is planning is not to you How did I find out On Myspace if you even remember that of all fucking places On top of that she and who I thought was my friend fucked behind my back Since then I ve turned to alcohol to numb the pain Over the last decade I ve had my share of ups and downs but the valleys have been long dark and never equaling the peaks When I was about I ended up in the hospital because of a date with Xanax and schnapps After that I was diagnosed with severe depression Fast forward to more a more present time Off antidepressants for years yr salary plus day per diem house truck getting out of debt and things are looking up right No not exactly Growing up in the lower class I ve learned that money isn t everything material possessions don t mean shit I m still alone and slowly realizing that all my chances are gone I mentioned earlier about the whore but that wasn t my only encounter with love I ve been involved with two others but one only used me for sex and the other just got away Just to make things fun lets throw in candidate number four Someone whom seemed like a perfect match Smart pretty shared the same hobbies Yeah you know the catch is coming She was engaged to my best friend On top of that they were living with me After a long and emotionally draining love triangle I accepted what was happening and they got married and eventually moved out I haven t talked to either of them in years Lets come a little closer to the present day about months ago the one who absolutely destroyed me texted me Stupidly I carried the conversation I mean I thought I was finally moving on The messages eventually stopped until two months ago I can t remember if I made contact or if she did I knew that this is a toxic situation and I should ve distanced myself from it but I just couldn t help myself About a month ago I came the closest I have ever been to actually taking my own life sending apology messages to my mom and sisters The last thing I want to do is cause my family grief Now to me sitting in a hotel writing this sorry sob story Conversations with my ex continue knowing there will never be a future between us Absolutely no self esteem to even look for anyone Let alone a tinder account that has gone nowhere The feeling to finally end it is getting stronger by the day I m at wits end here I travel of the year so the comfort of home is a rare escape that I almost never have and I think it would be so much easier for a stranger to be found dead in any given community that I am found in I just thought it would be nice for someone even just a random person on the internet to read just a small portion of this fucked up dream before it is forever silenced,"Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Seeking Help, Progress Update, Mood Tracking, Cause of Distress","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Maladaptive Coping, Mental Distress, Mood Tracking, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

Nietzsche for the Interested and Depressed Let me begin by dispelling a common misconception Nietzsche is not a nihilist If you associate him with nihilism dear reader it may be easier for you to understand what I am about to say if you pretend that you have never heard the name of Friedrich Nietzsche I find that many individuals come to a point where they stop look around and realize that they are a mouse in a labyrinth hunting for cheese however not only do they seem to be losing the game but they don t quite see the point of even playing They find that everything around them is an false image So much phoniness surrounds them with no escape Then they look at themselves and find that they have nothing to live for Congratulations friend if this is you you have stumbled upon the dark truth of man You have made it half the way the way there but I feel you have one more conclusion to draw that will return purpose to your life Beginning with the arguments of Plato Socrates and other Greek philosophers the original purpose of man was to follow a telos a goal to seek the purest form of the self For these thinkers there was a pure form of justice of triangles of logic and of man that were concealed by images projected by the objects themselves and by culture and only through argumentation can one find these Forms in a sort of team effort This sort of thinking provides at the very least a basis for morals and is the foundation for the character we try to instill in children Remember even before you started school how your mothers tried to teach you to be honest and kind as though they were inherent characteristics of man Eventually people began to question the existence of these Forms such as Immanuel Kant Friedrich Nietzsche Joseph Conrad among others Each of them provided their alternatives to these forms Likewise you seeker of truth have found that the forms in and of themselves are lies and it is here you Nietzsche Conrad Holden Caufield and Hamlet have found common ground however it is time to move back from the abyss and find a role and participate in the grand play of this world Nietzsche provides a solution for this issue Beginning with the given that ALL morality is a fiction a construct of society rather than attempting to distinguish truth from fiction the distinction must be made between fiction and better fiction Fictions range from an appreciation of Mozart and the Golden Rule to playing hockey or going to the club But with no grounding for even this quest for fictions it begs the question Why bother with these fictions The answer is That is life A life consists of a collection of actions of doing of being of finding whatever interests you KNOWING THAT IT IS NOT TRUE Football for example consists men running about attempting to move a pigskin and tackling each other but millions of people have adopted this fiction and made the rules a part of their lives Conrad expresses the pursuit of better fictions as turning to work Work is any activity that produces a better understanding of the self and that provides joy While science has discovered that we are a bunch of atoms you can do nothing with that information Unless of course you are a biochemist I haven t expressed all that I would have liked due to homework that I ve been putting off please comment with questions comments hate love criticism and I will try to answer accordingly TL DR You may have realized that the truth is we are a bunch of atoms however the point of life is not necessarily to find truth but to find more ways to enjoy life and provide substance for it Look at Maximus Pryme comment for a more focused analysis of Nietzsche than my rambling essay,"Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Seeking Help, Progress Update, Mood Tracking, Cause of Distress",Miscellaneous

Everyday is filled with painI really just need someone to listen that I don t know in real life because I m scared of the consequences of bringing this up I will try to not make a wall of text as much as I can but please try to read I ve had a history of anxiety depression and currently am taking lamotrigene and klonopin to manage that I m and entering my senior year of college soon and I am so fucking scared In less than a year I will be graduating college with a terrible gpa can t be better than even if I make straight A s from now because I was in an Engineering program that took me years to figure out that I couldn t handle so it ruined that I became a general studies major in math music and education because I couldn t decide on what exactly my passions are and feel directionless I m going to try to branch out more but I m basically always stressed out because of job opportunities after college and losing all of my friends I ve made over the years as they move on with their lives and find jobs elsewhere This is all important because I had the best friend in the world for quite a few years and a little less than a year ago we decided that we couldn t live without eachother might as well date lots of happy crying and whatnot We fell in love quite quickly and I will say that I was probably in love with her for years seeing as we hung out about every other day A couple of months ago when our old leases ran out we moved in together Everything seemed perfect I found a reason to live my depression cured Mutual love really is the best thing in the world and without it life seems gray Quickly after moving in together she became distant and less affectionate Last monday she spoke about an old ex who she felt ended prematurely and has been texting him regularly and full on cried about how she felt torn She s also depressed and bipolar so it could be a phase but it hurts a lot all the same I can t in a reasonable amount of space convince someone that doesn t know me or her how much I feel for her and how important she is to me but just know that I literally love her more than my own parents She s become much less open about discussing the future and when asked about our relationship she says We ll see where it goes It s all driving me mad life really isn t worth it without love right She brought me the most happiness anyone had ever brought me and now I feel crushed because it s much less reciprocated If she doesn t leave me now she ll leave me when she graduates in less than a year it feels like It hurts so much I live with her I see her posters her room her clothes her food EVERYTHING Everyday I can t just escape it Everything in my home screams at me and tells me to be depressed I can t walk to the refridgerator without seeing something and saying Huh we got that when we were really happy I ll never be happier than that It fucking sucks It doesn t help that she brings up bad stuff and then has been leaving frequently for vacations while I m left to do summer school classes with intense indoor work and struggling with mustering the willpower to continue despite my pain I feel so much pain that I can t sleep at night I wake up in the morning and I feel like I fucked up so hard by falling madly in love with a girl with so many personal issues in the sense that I don t know if it s even her fault Everyday I daydream about ending all of this pain researching different ways that might be painless and entertaining the idea of just getting my klonopin script next month and taking it all with some liquor or something I don t know man I m in the most stressful part of my life and ontop of that I love this girl like no other I ve been in a few relationships before but I just know that life can t possibly get better than that I reached the happiest point of my life with my best friend and girlfriend and continuing on with this amount of pain feels pointless A life without my best friend is not worth living she s the only person I ve ever been able to confide in On top of this I feel like I should admit that the past month or two I have become a mild alcoholic drinking the equivalent of a pack nearly every day I also have started smoking weed about once an hour while awake and benzos do a wonderful job of suppressing the pain I take adderal though so that allows me to do all of this but still get good grades in school somehow I do it all to hide from reality Oh man I m just laughing at how fucked up things are getting so quickly I m sorry if this was a bit long but I appreciate your time,"Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Positive Coping, Seeking Help, Progress Update, Mood Tracking, Cause of Distress","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Mood Tracking, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

My friend is slowly getting worse and has made threats to kill himself I m not sure what steps to take Hi everyone Best wishes to everyone and I m so sorry that anyone has to go through what you all have gone through I myself have thankfully been able to get out of my own depression and am now in a better place My friend however just seems to be getting worse He s only Just turned a few months ago actually Lately he s been making threats I wouldn t call them threats but the word that I m looking for escapes me and saying things like if my dad s gun case wasn t locked I don t know what I would do and things of that nature very very openly to me He said once that he might do it soon if things don t get better I ask him why and he says I just can t deal with it anymore He s been very reckless lately When he was younger at around or so he got his hands on some strong prescription pain killers and benzodiazepines which he stole from family and his parents Ever since then he s loved the idea of getting more He hasn t tried any pharmaceutical opiates in years but I guess for some people the feeling just can t ever be forgotten Then he found out about Kratom Kratom is great and for responsible users it s a godsend I use it myself every once in a while and it s fantastic Great for pain and sleep Ever since he got some he s started abusing it It started out as something he did every once in a while but within a week he had said f it and started using it every time something went wrong in his life He uses it as a crutch if you will One day I passively mentioned phenibut and then he suddenly ordered some I deeply regret that He abuses this now too Phenibut is a nootropic that has anti anxiety characteristics It s notorious for its rebound anxiety and withdrawal after being abused I honestly don t know how much he s used of Phenibut but he s had some pretty bad anxiety now that he says he s off of it Now he has been talking about getting some strong pharmaceutical opiates again I tried to tell him that that road might not lead him to happiness and that he could prossibly be worse in the long run but he just retorted with isn t the goal of life to have as much fun as possible and be as happy as possible I tried to reason with him and say no the goal is the be fully happy with the situation you re in without the use of substances I may have been wrong it s fine to seek help from substances But he hasn t seen a psychiatrist or anything so at this point he s self medicating and poorly at that He s always struggled with depersonalization derealization as well And he says it s been getting worse In my opinion I think the substances he s been testing with may be making him worse in the long run He doesn t seem to want help though There s other stuff that I won t list here one of which I think could possibly be messing up his brain s dopamine system but he doesn t even want to try stopping it I mean if it could help and you re pretty desparate why not But I m not him and he s probably in a completely different headspace than I m in Also he has a LOT of anxiety stemming from the fact that he ll need to be going to college soon and honestly I feel like he s still very much a kid inside His parents gave him the option of waiting one year but he saw his other friend just decide not to go to college after getting a well paying job during his gap year Reading through this post I m pretty sure that I m not looking at all of this from the right perspective It s been a long time since I was in a situation similar to his so I m having trouble putting the shoes on the other foot so I apologize,"Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Positive Coping, Seeking Help, Progress Update, Mood Tracking, Cause of Distress","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Maladaptive Coping, Mental Distress, Mood Tracking, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

I m sad and the lights have gone out Idk if this matters but year old female in post secondary school diagnosed double depression social anxiety eating disorder anorexia restricting or nos it s being debated bpd which is also debated ptsd being debated with bpd and complex ptsd generalized anxiety don t know why psych hasn t mentioned this Self harm but not currently active Today I did something I never thought I would do again I turned out the lights Since September I have been unable to sleep in a completely dark room due to some scary experiences I had been having I have very bad insomnia and at the time nothing was working I would be stuck in state of extreme tiredness but mind too active to sleep Nothing seemed to help My mom gave me Nyquill to try in addition to my prescribed sleep meds that the doctor couldn t change The nyquill helped for a bit but it got to the point I was taking sips a night which is about mg mg of the drug It became too expensive and i switched to the pill form which was cheaper sleepez which also didn t help So I kept taking more and more to the point I would take up to a night at mg just so i could sleep for a few hours Of course this isn t healthy so what I was essentially doing was overdosing to the point of getting weaker and eventually passing out every night because it was the only way to sleep When I did this I would hallucinate And would lie in bed terrified of the creatures and figures that would appear in front of me Since then I have had sleep meds switched multiple times still not helping and I have not fallen asleep without a light being on since I was too afraid I would see them again as ionly saw them in the dark so I would have a light that would light up the room enough for me to see around it on everynight I always feel the need to lock my door and close my bathroom door not completely with a tiny crack in it at night I haven t been alone in the dark since then Until tonight Tonight I was lying in bed feeling overwhelmed about life and how I realized that there would never be a happy ending for me There never was going to be I told my boyfriend I wanted to have a break for a bit in reality I would just like to break up with him but I feel like his depression would get worse if I did I tried breaking it off many times over the time we have been dating But he always convinced me to give him another chance All along deep down I knew it would end in disaster I always knew I would die soon and I didn t want him to be even more hurt by me I do love him but he s holding me back from the one thing that will bring me peace The best moment of my life was last September The moments before I woke up in the hospital The moments where I couldn t see anything I was comatose Unresponsive Couldn t breathe and my blood was poisoned my stomach bleeding from the inside I had attempted suicide which would have been lethal if I had not been caught in time I don t remember doing it I don t remember the feeling of dying or the feeling of someone discovering me conscious or the emt s taking me away Nothing I wish I knew When I woke up and realized where I was My first thoughtr was I was so close I was so close to achieving what I wanted for so long It was perfect Not feeling anything having no thoughts no worries for a while I wouldn t trade that for the world Yet I was forced back into a nightmare I have been living in for years I guess you can say I m resentful of that But the doctors think I m doing better thats what matters right Everytime she says im doing better and i just stare So I must not be as bad as I was before Yet all I want now is to die I want this all to end and I know how to do it I ve been prepared for a while and have just I don t know not had the motivation I guess I ve been too tired and sick and I m tired of being sick and tired anymore I m tired of having to keep up with conversations or activities I found at least semi interesting in the past I barely go to class I mostly lie in my bed and use the computer And that I don t have paticence for anymore I can t concentrate my stomach always hurts and im starving but I don t want to eat because I ll be fat and ugly but if i don t eat my headache will get worse and I won t be able to sleep But my head always hurts and I can t sleep anymore What s the point The light is off and I m stuck in the dark and I don t think that light will ever turn on again Tell Brendon I love him And that I always loved him Maybe in another life we could have had our happy ending but it s not this one Tell my family I loved them all and that I m sorry My snuggle buddy will need someone else to sleep with now Don t let them make her sleep alone I m not afraid of them anymore They can come for me and I won t scream I won t fight I just ask that they make it quick and take me away from this hell EDIT I m using a throwaway because my boyfriend knows my main reddit account name,"Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping,

Paranoid verbally abused heart racing racing thoughts I have been diagnosed with Schizoaffective disorder That basically means that I sometimes have problems controlling my mood or my way of thinking isn t aligned with reality sometimes So I was invited to dinner with my family for Passover and everything was all fine and dandy Then everyone left and we said our goodbyes I helped my mom with the table and some other cleaning around the kitchen I asked if she needed anymore help and she said no In response I asked if I could use the upstairs massage chair and she said ok So I went upstairs unbothered for about minutes to use the chair Keep in mind that I wasn t bothering anyone and was minding my own business No harm no foul The chair has a timer on it so that I know how much time remains At around minutes left my mom s husband stepfather whatever you want to call it comes upstairs to switch it off and he starts to belittle me with his words how this is his house and that I need his permission to use it So I left and walked downstairs away from him but he just wouldn t shut up like a broken record I went to the kitchen and followed soon after I asked mom if she needed some help and NOW she said that her husband helped her out AFTER she specifically told me that she didn t need anymore help Then I continued to distance myself from him and still no talking He s like You can be seen but not heard I understand if a grown up tells that to a child but I m here Don t I have a right to defend myself if I am being verbally or physically abused even if it means expressing my point of view with a shaky voice I told him ENOUGH but he still continues to talk I m not a little kid I got the point minutes ago and he still gabbers on and on and on Then I go upstairs to the second floor of the house to get my belongings and leave But he prevents me by blocking the doorway and still rambles on I m telling you he REALLY knows how to piss someone off Then after I grab my things and head toward the door he has the audacity to extend his hand to say bye All I do is walk past him put on my slippers and leave on my bicycle In the middle of all the arguments and the created tension my mom continued to defend him Like WTF I didn t do anything to anybody and if he didn t want me to use it he should have said so from the get go So I m seriously going to consider an ultimatum either mom divorces him or I will follow through with my suicide I just can t continue to live in fear like this I thought he would change but I was just being delusional Last time I checked it was also my mom s house and she has lived there longer than he has He moved in with her back in but she has lived there for over years stretching way back into the s I m telling you right now if I don t commit suicide my paranoid thoughts will lead me to believe that he will come to my apartment and threaten to kill me I am only miles away from where they live because my mom helped me with an apartment close to her I guess for protection He can at any time take the card to the community open the door to the building and unlock my front door The problem with him is that he likes to pursue things till the very end It s always one sided in his case I don t say anything but he just talks and talks to no end The things he does to empower himself is really sick and I m the one with the disorder Never ending verbal abuse and condescending tone with him I am seriously considering filing a restraining order against him I have never filed a restraining order against anyone but he might be the first The problem is it takes time to make it official and the decision is tentative because they have to hear out not only my side of the story but his as well I m worried that the court might take his side over mine and revoke my attempt to issue the restraining order I don t want to wait to be physically injured to use that as evidence to justify my support for the restraining order He might be married to my mom and live in the same household as her but that doesn t give him the right to treat me the way he does And who knows how he treats my mom behind closed doors I m know I m repeating myself but it has to be said I know I was a guest in my mom s home but I m no stranger and I wasn t disturbing anybody If anything it was like my presence wasn t even in the house until you actually came into the room That s how quiet I was Typing some of this out in writing in my quiet apartment has helped calm my mood a little bit but I am still feeling highly anxious about the situation I don t provoke anyone and I mind my own business Don t start nothing and there won t be nothing I live by that motto P S I flipped him the bird yesterday while I was trying on new clothes after he told me to suck it in It s not just HOW he said it but the WAY he said it with a smug look on his face and arrogant tone He was obviously referring to my stomach I have body fat and I have a flat stomach with a little bit of fat around the sides but not much abs Regardless he just HAS to talk shit just to feel better about himself The things he does to boost his self esteem,"Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Positive Coping, Seeking Help, Progress Update, Mood Tracking, Cause of Distress","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Mental

I want the sadness to endHello r SuicideWatch So I m a year old high school student who has been contemplating suicide lately For the past years I ve felt depressed almost all of the time I can t pinpoint any external factors in my life that might make me feel this way While I ve never been officially diagnosed with clinical depression or anything both of my parents have so I believe it s not too far fetched at all to say I may be genetically predisposed for it or something Some stretches of time have felt harder than others This past week is one of those times I ve had trouble getting to sleep I ve woken up late or early every day I ve had trouble focusing I don t feel engaged in anything I do I can t get myself to do any school work and I ve cried for at least half an hour every day The worst of it all has been the suicidal thoughts I ve unwillingly visualized myself killing myself in various ways The thoughts are simultaneously terrifying and liberating I don t think I have the nerve to act on them but I worry sometimes I ve been taking medication generic Lexapro every day and meeting with a counselor for an hour every week Both of these have a positive impact for sure but I don t know that they re enough I still feel hopeless sometimes like my life isn t worth living I feel miserable The worst part of it is that I feel like nobody would really notice if I did kill myself I feel like those who would notice wouldn t care all that much My mom gets mad at me when all I can do is mope around the house My dad rarely sees me and never seems to take my depression seriously One of my little brothers seems to despise me at worst and feel neutral towards me at best The other is a real sweet heart but said to me earlier today that nobody loves me That got to me All of my friends except for one have grown really distant from me over the past year The only friend I have who makes me feel wanted and loved by somebody has been out of the country for about months and won t return home for about more I don t know if I can last that long I miss her so much I honestly feel like I want to die right now I want the sadness to stop I can t handle it I feel worthless right now Sorry if it seems like I m just seeking attention but I m hoping getting this off my chest will help Any advice support comments etc are appreciated a lot,"Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Positive Coping, Seeking Help, Progress Update, Mood Tracking, Cause of Distress","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Mood Tracking, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

The loneliness during lockdown has now really gotten to me Ever since the lockdown I ve been gradually getting more and more detached from reality all the games I play have now become boring and having no contact with my friends really doesn t help As of writing my sleep schedule has started to make me wake up at night and sleep through the entire day I always drift off at around AM and then wake up at PM at the earliest and latest As a result my routine I m trying to get to is ripped apart because of it I ve been administered around two sleeping pills every night multiple times but my body quickly adapts to it and puts up a tolerance to the sleeping pills after one or two nights when given a dosage and one of my siblings are convinced I m suffering from Insomnia I m convinced it s getting worse by each passing night I can barely be bothered to get myself up from bed now due to lack of motivation I m not good with arts writing or music anymore and the games I once enjoyed playing I ve now grown more distant with each passing day losing more motivation by each one I have a feeling that I might lose so much motivation that one day when I go to sleep and wake up I ll just go back to sleep again And then the cycle will repeat itself School is not helping either I can t cope with the online work given especially since I only have one computer that is not used for playing games As a result I ve given that up too I just can t cope with this lockdown any longer and that s coming from a borderline introvert TL DR Lockdown sucks signed by an introvert,"Mental Distress, Seeking Help, Progress Update, Mood Tracking, Cause of Distress","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Maladaptive Coping, Mental Distress, Mood Tracking, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

BF Constantly Threatening SuicideSo I m a little nervous about making this post because I don t really want to be found out but this is beyond my understanding anymore The man I have dated for a long time is a widely intelligent attractive man In the beginning it was pure magic We spent a lot of time together we went out on dates etc Then I moved to college and came back home It was toward the end of last year that this all began Out of nowhere he started threatening to hang himself because I was being negative While I ve always known to take threats seriously I kinda let it slide because maybe I pissed him off and didn t realize it He blames me for being negative and a drama queen and this is causing him to want to kill himself I know this isn t the full story I know there must be something else going on At the end of the day I am not responsible for his suicide I am not legally bound to him in any way Problems got worse when one day he came over and we were fighting about something stupid The fight rose to the point where he is screaming at me saying I am going to hurt you and me begging him not to touch me Eventually he grabbed me called me stupid among other things I cowered and threw my hands over my face attempting to shield myself thinking he was actually going to strike But he threw me aside I begged him to calm down and he wasn t being rational He finally agreed to relax but then started screaming again At this point he was thrown out for threatening me Fast forward Most days it is ok I don t hear from him much and try to give him space to work on his projects but these episodes of suicide can occur when I least expect it At times he told me he had a rope and made a noose out of it He tried it and caused harm to himself apparently I honestly believe that some of this is false The other day I fell asleep on him and he told me he still had the noose in his closet if I don t stop being negative The problem with all of this is that it is starting to affect my level of sanity If I don t hear from him for like half a day I immediately start thinking he has hurt himself I know you ll day get rid of him I am just wondering if there is a real way to diagnose the problem I wish I knew what to do,"Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Seeking Help, Progress Update, Mood Tracking, Cause of Distress","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Maladaptive Coping, Mental Distress, Mood Tracking, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

Long Story Need supportI ve been depressed suicidal for a long time but it s gotten worse over the past year It started last year I chose my best friend to be the one to take my virginity because I trusted him He felt honored that I had chosen him and it was a big deal Unfortunately I got a really bad ovarian cyst so we couldn t do it right away We promised to wait until I was completely better He broke that promise when he started dating his cheating girlfriend a few months after She has another boyfriend and she s cheating on him with my best friend and she has made excuses for not wanting to break up with her original boyfriend for my best friend The fact that he broke our promise really hurt me A few months after he started dating her I was sexually harassed on my way home from school I was on a public train during the winter and this guy started harassing me Another man defended me However the offender proceeded to threaten the guy by saying he was going to shoot him He didn t pull out a gun but the threat was there I got out of the train as soon as the doors opened After that I wanted to see my best friend for support I told him what happened and had asked him if we could meet up over the weekend the incident took place on a Monday But he decided that spending the weekend at his cheating girlfriend s place was more important than helping me I couldn t keep my feelings about everything anymore and I decided to talk to my best friend about it We got into a fight over it It turns out that he had forgotten about the promise we had made and that has permanently changed the way I saw the world People always say to think about your loved ones and how they would feel if you committed suicide but after what he did I couldn t help but think that if it was so easy to forget a promise that big how easy is it to forget someone s existence If I committed suicide no one would miss me They d simply forget about me my abusive family my friends everyone so it wouldn t matter He also tried justifying him choosing to stay at his cheating girlfriend s place over supporting me but the thing is it s not like she was in trouble or in need of support or anything He also didn t have work I needed him and in a moment of need he picked his girlfriend over me which is something he promised to never do but I guess he broke that promise out of desperation considering how many failed relationships he s had He said if I had considered if the guy who harassed me was bluffing about the gun Of course I had considered it and so did the police however threats of using a weapon are taken extremely seriously Plus I didn t know if he was bluffing or not He could have been but he could also have been serious I told him that work is understandable for not being able to see me during that time but going to his girlfriend s house instead of helping me during an important time is not and that he can go to her house at any time He said Still it s what I chose to do cause I wanted to We fought some more I did hurl a few insults here and there and he said he s not going to talk to me for insulting him for spending time with his girlfriend We eventually apologized and made up The thing is the damage has been done and I m still hurt by everything I haven t completely forgiven him either I can t look at the world the same This combined with living in an abusive household and being made of my family and family friends about me eating I m skinny has taken a toll I think about suicide almost all the time and I have no one to talk to I ve tried antidepressants but the ones I ve tried so far haven t worked for me so I m still looking for the right one I see a psychiatrist and a counselor at school but it s summer break and I can t see anyone now especially because I live with a narcissistic mom I ve attempted suicide a few times during the summer including on my birthday I can t stop thinking about suicide I don t know what to do I ve contacted hotlines a few times but I don t want to be a nuisance and they re not always helpful Nothing seems to be working anymore I want to die I wish I was never born I hate the world I don t want to be here anymore,"Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Positive Coping, Seeking Help, Progress Update, Mood Tracking, Cause of Distress","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Mood Tracking, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

What the fuck did I just drink I was at a private party people I knew everyone there We bought some beers bottle of wiskey brandy and some energy drinks Later in the night we ran out of drinks and my friend s gf suggested she can bring out a bit of homemade stuff that her mom makes from her basement We agreed and she brought something that she claimed had alchohol It was like drinking fire but realy easy to down nice flavour and I didn t even need to drink something like cola to down it more easily Got me fucked up in few mins Realy strong clean alchohol high Me and my gf were the only ones who drank it she did shot and I did Next day I had visual audio and sensory halucionations on the bottomn corners of my FOV I saw realy detailed smoke every time I exhaled and when I closed my eyes I could hear my gf breathing in my face and even saying something just like in that moment when we drank this stuff I thought it was just me and didn t tell anyone but later I saw on my gf s insta story that she had absolutely same things going on smoke everywhere and she kept feeling my breath on her face I am realy weirded out Has anyone heared of a halucionations from alchohol We both were on alchohol nicotine caffeine and sleep deprived for h when this happened but real weird that we had the same effects Even today I can barely see a small haze on my FOV when I look for it What the fuck,Mood Tracking,"Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Maladaptive Coping, Miscellaneous, Mood Tracking, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

"I have no idea what is happening to me, but what I'm feeling is absolute emptiness, and despair. I'm numb to everything I think. I hope this feeling ends soon, I've been this way for the past week, it's felt like years though and it's horrific. I'm so tired... So tired. I need a break. I want to sleep and have good dreams. I want to sit still and feel peace. I want to let go of the white hot emotions inside of me. I try and try to let go and to soothe myself, but to no avail. Time after time, the cycle repeats, and I end up in the same place. I don't know why I expect things to be different sometimes. Hope seems so stupid right now. I'm trying to have it, though. I'm so lonely. And being with people makes it worse. Even those who I think I care for.

Screenwriting Course Scripts and Characters that commit suicide and other parts of dealing with depression I ve been a little low lately so this matters to me I m long past the days where every moment feels like breathing underwater so it only hurts a little I wrote the outline for my script a year and a half ago when I was in the worst throws of my depression and was nearly hospitalized And now as I am in the class that comes after that basic course I have to finish the script I like how the script has grown and changed and it certainly has a broader scope than the depression that haunted me But today I had to write the little part where the character considers committing suicide It was like I was seeing myself doing his actions There is another character that is the voice of depression and every line I wrote was the ideas that I had in my head It was like writing down my thoughts from the past Too easy to write which meant I could zoom past it faster but I could never watch this script come to life It would be too traumatic I couldn t let other people see that too Especially people who know what its like I know it isn t the same now that I m much better but I feel like I could see myself cutting to stop myself from committing suicide or looking over the edge of a building sad that I was hesitating and that I wouldn t do it Confused if that was really what I wanted Another complexity I feel like I ve become the expert on suicide hospitalization therapy group therapy anti depressants and depression within my class Too many scripts don t get it right It s never as straightforward as they write it Even now it s not straightforward a part of me very small wants to kill myself A larger part of me wants to be off antidepressants even if it means that I fall back into depression An even larger part of me is ready to cut myself at a moment s notice to just stop pain And now I will talk about the script during class like opening up too much of a wound We will see how much it bothers me I don t think it will too much but who knows right Someone in my class wasn t clear about what the character was doing accident or attempt To me it sounded like a suicide attempt and if it is well I guess I ll have to tell her that there s no realistic way that she would get out of the hospital the same day Even if it is an accident someone would be asking her about her intent My life keeps getting more and more complex the farther I am from the epicenter of my depression Not that I don t have depression getting much closer to stable though I know this is long and I though this isn t entirely related But I just wanted to show this to people who know what it s like to consider suicide or know a bit about the ambiguity treatment and reactions that follow it,"Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Progress Update, Mood Tracking","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Maladaptive Coping, Mental Distress, Mood Tracking, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

First Draft of my Suicide NoteSo I posted earlier on here about my plans to go through with suicide and I m in the process of picking a good date to complete it It s weird to have strangers reading over what will be my final words on this earth but strangers are all I have right now so I am thankful for the people who can at least read over it and give some feedback Names are purposefully left out Hey everyone Hold onto your hats because this is going to get emotional I want to start out by saying that I m not angry Not at all I don t blame anyone for this and I take full responsibility for my actions I m not going to place the blame on other people or make tapes This is my fault I have left my depression untreated for an extremely long time and it got to a point where I could no longer get better It s too late I ve driven away everyone I cared about because of it and I don t blame them one bit for leaving I know a lot of people hate me for their own reasons I was a terrible secret keeper and I loved way too fast and sometimes I seemed crazy but I guess this actually confirms it I understand I hate me too I hope people can forgive me and look at this from a different light I tried the pills the therapists the self help guides It didn t work and now I don t care for it to work I m so tired of everything going on As some of you may know I was diagnosed with HSV which is herpes That diagnosis hit me pretty hard and then a short time later I was sextorted which means I sent explicit photos to someone and they threatened to send them to my family unless I sent more I had to comply I felt dirty and horrible A lot of people will probably think I m selfish and if that helps you get over this then think that But I promise I m just tired and I m trying to do what is truly best for me I didn t mean to make anyone hurt and I am truly sorry to the few people who actually cared about me When I m gone I don t want a fancy funeral or costly ceremonies I m perfectly alright with being forgotten My sister has access to my Facebook now so if you want to save some special memories then delete the account go ahead I am certainly not someone to be remembered and I don t want people going on about how much they miss me in death when they never cared to show it in my life The same people who had no problem abandoning me before should have no problem with my absence I don t want to hear apologies or sympathies I m dead It does no good to me now that you showed up I would like the funeral to be family and a few close friends if any feel like attending I understand if you don t want to go and you should feel no guilt if you miss it I made this to to let people know that I made this choice and that I wholeheartedly believed it to be the best one There is a huge burden that will be off my shoulders and I honestly can t wait I m ready to finally commit to this and although I will miss so many people namely my mom my sister and my Dad I just know that this had to happen Now I can finally be okay I hope everyone can come to forgive me some day I love you all Me,"Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Progress Update, Mood Tracking, Cause of Distress","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Maladaptive Coping, Mental Distress, Mood Tracking, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

I m falling apartI ve fucked up a lot in my lifetime I m years old and somehow I ve managed to go from daddy s little angel who went to catholic school and loved Disneyland to a pathetic whore burnout who cuts herself and can t go a day without having something go horribly wrong I ve worked really hard to go from the girl I was last year as depicted in the second description to someone who may have a shitty past but has some self respect and who has stopped cutting It s been almost months and for the first time since the nd month I m considering it Here s the story Freshman year and guy who s name I m going to leave out but for now we re going to call him Jake Jake invited me to his house for Halloween and when I got there he somehow convinced me to do some sexual acts I wasn t quite ready for I never said no but I felt as if it was necessary for me to do it in order for him to like me So I did and then he dumped me like I was trash A few weeks later he was bored with whatever poor girl he d convinced to fuck him and he came back to me told me he d changed he d found God and he was a new guy Nope He did it again this time taking even more than the last And again dumped me like I was trash I hated him but more than that I hated myself for falling for it twice I smoked weed to forget about it and I cut because it was better to feel a physical pain that I could control than an emotional pain in which Jake had all the control I stole liquor from my moms cabinet and stole money from her wallet for weed Then I dated another guy who we ll call Zach for our sakes Zack was a coke addict he d been to prison ran away from home stole thousands of dollars from stores beat up people and cars and windows and whatever for money I was lonely he was there He took my virginity And then my mom found out About everything She admitted me in the hospital and I ve been on medications and things ever since And finally this morning I looked in the mirror and thought you know what Jake is missing out I m beautiful and smart and funny And even if I don t always believe it not many people hesitate to remind me And I felt like I was walking on cloud until lunch that is Some random dumbass freshman asked me if I was prganant because he d heard I was a whore and it sort of looks like it I held my shit together and laughed it off Then Jake cussed me out because his new toy found out about what he did to me Apparently it s my fault he s an abusive mysogenistic ass I came home and told my mom my best friend my companion my everything about what a shitty day I d had She blew me off over and over again talked over me told me I was being annoying for the rest of the night Finally I decided to just sit in the corner until her friends left and when they did she and I laughed and sang songs and joked and all that Then I said something about having school tomorrow and it being in the morning and she started yelling at me saying I was irresponsible because of my low grades and how I have no right to blame her for my being up so late and how she always does everything for me and now she has to be my alarm clock too I just it kills me when she s mad and today of all days I can t handle it I just want my mom to give me a big hug and tell me it s okay and tell me I m beautiful and all that but the thing is she s called me a whore too She s said I m so fat I look pregnant She s cussed me out before And she blames me for everything that happened with Jake She hates me as much as I hate myself even if she loves me as her daughter And it s slowly tearing me apart,"Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Seeking Help, Progress Update, Mood Tracking, Cause of Distress","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Maladaptive Coping, Mental Distress, Mood Tracking, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

"47 y/o male. Divorced. In stable relationship now - finally. 
 
 While visiting my parents this weekend, I opened a box which contained painful memories. One was so many letters and cute things from my courtship with my ex-wife and mother of my child. I’ve been able to come to a place where I don’t fully blame myself for the end of my marriage. I get that it was both of us, only I did the acting out. Of course.
 
 What is more painful tonight is that my mom kept every letter my college ex girlfriend wrote me. Reading back, it’s so easy to see the pure love she had that was so hard to see then. She was also the one who took the most emotional abuse, when I was at worst and had absolutely zero self-awareness. All these letters and pics showed a genuinely good person who did not deserve any of what I subjected her to, and that is difficult.
 
 It’s been over 20 years. I since had a 14 year marriage which ended, have a ten year-old son, fell hard, and have gotten up. I have my pain, but I now manage myself better than ever. I have a partner of three years I treat well. I just feel for this woman who so clearly loved me, but got the worst of me, tonight.
 
 We last had contact in about 2005 or 2006. It was still loving and caring, inquiring about each other’s friends and families. I know she has three kids and a good life.I tried an FB message about eight years go which was never read - no assumptions made. I want to say how sorry I am. She loved me so goddamn much, but I also don’t see the use. The right thing is to cherish what I have and not repeat this a third time in my life.","Mood Tracking, Progress Update","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Mood Tracking, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

Why is the milk gone Why did you forgot to buy milk Well that s the interesting question See you were going to get some on the way home yesterday but then you remember that you need some bread as well so u went to bread house however the alcohol store was on the way to the bread house So you went there first just because you been doing quite a lot of drinking alone and if by recently you mean last year and the have this new alcohol apple flavor vodka Which was pretty cool and you brought and then forgot to buy milk so really the milk is gone because of vodka but really you only went to buy vodka cuz it s been a cloudy day and you wanted to cheer yourself up a bit and it s only been a cloudy day because of the temperature differential brought on by east moving winds and pressure fluctuations So really the milk is gone because of the weather but the weather is only there because of the atmosphere which formed about billion years ago result of gas escaping from earths interior so the milk is gone because of the earth But the earth is only there because a gas cloud condensed into the sun and the solar system a few billion years ago and all of that came from the Big Bang billion of years before that so really the milk is gone because space and time materialized out of nothing billion years ago So if that the case Did the universe always knew that billion years when it exploded formed into galaxies and stars and they gave rise to planets and planets developed ecosystem single cell life complex organisms humans human society domestication of cows the invention of coffee milk in coffee fridges and finally you that you would eventually run out of milk billion years later Well maybe If You re playing snooker or pool or whatever and you hit a ball at a certain angle and speed and if you have a good enough computer you can say where the ball are going to go right It s all predetermined If you take the same shot times the outcome will be the same times well if the Big Bang happens time over just the way it it did billion years ago would you run out of milk a times billion later And doesn t that mean that you re life is already determined Like day of your birth and death was already predicted the moment came into being and everything has to happen in a certain way just that way just like a pool game No definitely not We ve got free will right I mean just because the universe is made of of atoms bumping into each other that have to act in a certain way based on what happened before and just because your brain is made up of atoms that doesn t mean they have to do the same thing and all are the part of the same system you can still just decided to do stuff right BECAUSE IF NOT THEN WE ARE JUST BALLS IN A COSMIC GAME OF POOL WITH NO FREE WILL AT ALL MEANING WE RE JUST ROBOTS CAUGHT IN A DETERMINISTIC SYSTEM WITH JUST ILLUSION OF CHOICE BUT REALLY HAVING NO CONTROL WHATSOEVER OVER OUR LIFE DELUDING OUR SELF INTO THINKING WE RE SOMEHOW DIFFERENT TO ALL THE OTHER ATOMS IN THE UNIVERSE AND THAT WOULD MEAN YOU VE NEVER MADE A REAL CHOICE AND YOU NEVER WILL AND WHATEVER YOU DECIDE TO DO NEXT IN LIFE ISN T A DECISION AT ALL BUT WAS ALWAYS GOING TO HAPPEN AND THERE S NO POINT TO EVER DOING ANYTHING EVER AGAIN BECAUSE EVERYTHING WAS PREDECIDED AT THE BEGINNING OF TIME AND LIFE AND LIFE IS COMPLETELY MEANINGLESS AND EMPTY AND FUCK IT FUCK MILK black coffee is fine,"Mental Distress, Seeking Help, Mood Tracking","Cause of Distress, Mood Tracking, Positive Coping"

The thought of the end is the only thing that makes me happy I m not entirely sure what to say I often find myself lost for words but now I need them more than ever I have been depressed for a while now and I have tried oh lord have I tried to get rid of it to make it disappear I no longer think I have the capability to be happy it seems almost impossible I m going to apologize in advance for the inevitable essay but this is my first post and I have a lot of things I need aired I need someone to hear me to listen to me before I explode First of all my mother died when I was she was and died suddenly Obviously there was a lot of heart ache sadness and so on the stuff you would normally expect from anyone who loved their mother My father worked away so my sister and I never had a stable home sometimes we lived with my Nan and Grandfather other times we would stay with my Auntie and then occasionally my other Nan would look after us My mother s mother was a wonderful person I finally allowed myself to open up to someone and she took me in with open arms She was the only person who would tell my father when he was wrong She died when I was To this day seeing my Grandfather cry was the most heart wrenching thing I have ever witnessed I then found a wonderful boyfriend he treated me like I was everything but of course my best friend didn t like sharing my time with someone else and then she left my life too I still miss her It was at this time that I had noticed that my eczema had started to get worse and nothing was curing it I took my skin problem to a doctor and was referred to a dermatologist He was baffled and had no idea what it was tried different tests and treatments but to no avail Since then I have been to various doctors around the UK travelling far and wide to seek treatment My condition got even worse my body was is covered Itchy and sore Later that year my uncle died and then so did my Grandfather I started to think it was all my fault and that maybe I was a curse to my family I tried to commit suicide three times and carved the shit out of my thighs I stopped eating properly because I thought I was enormous I weighed kg My boyfriend could no longer handle me I was erratic and self destructive He left after two years of suffering me It was at this point that I had really decided that life wasn t for me I was in pain all day every day because of my skin I had to leave school after my GCSE s because the pain was unbearable and I could hardly motivate myself to leave my bed I then got diagnosed with a new illness called Myasthenia Gravis for those who don t wish to Google the disease it is simply something which makes your muscles incredibly weak to the point where it is hard to walk eat and sometimes even talk I am now on steroids which is helping but the condition isn t curable I am just hoping that it will go into remission someday On top of all this I had to look after my year old sister since my grandparents were no longer around to do so Huff I am starting to feel like I am writing this for the wrong reasons I feel like I m writing a sob story and that wasn t what I wanted I ll quickly explain what happens after that I decided to get myself better mentally tried so unbelievably hard finally felt like I succeeded got my boyfriend back after a year of trying moved out of my house and into my boyfriend s parents house because my father was verbally abusive and kind of got my social life back on track But here I am now Back where I started Rejected all of my friends again Too afraid to leave the house My boyfriend is wonderful but I feel like he can t give me what I need I sit here every day feeling like there is a massive empty space inside of me I m desperately trying to find something to fill it but there is nothing I want nothing from this life anymore If I knew that I could die tomorrow without hurting my boyfriend or my sister I would do it I would end it I have no one to talk to because I am too afraid of losing my boyfriend again and I don t trust anyone else I am poor as shit because I had to leave school because of my illnesses and couldn t get a job for the same reason The government is also unwilling to help at all I am now kg heavier than I was before because of my medicines and I feel like an elephant I am terribly unsatisfied with the way that I look I have seen a glimpse of happiness and it is totally not worth the effort This sounds incredibly gay I have no idea who I am anymore and I am so scared for my future I just want to curl up into a ball and fade away I have tried to leave out my father in all of this because even thinking of him makes me angry however I will tell you this that man can go to hell for what he has put me through I am not living I m just wasting time TL DR Was depressed then happy ish and now I see no point in living,"Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Positive Coping, Seeking Help, Progress Update, Mood

Hello I don t want to be dramatic in this post it s not in my nature Instead I m going to talk out my plans why I feel this way and maybe have someone to talk to about it I m not looking to be diagnosed or be a patient to a therapist But just talk When I was years old my parents had their third child I was their first and I am their big brother They annoyed me and I annoyed them still do But they re my siblings and I love them A few months after my third sibling was born I started having these thoughts Terrible thoughts of ending my life at this very young age I had no friends I had no life I didn t do well in school and my parents always fought while I took care of my siblings I am now and my parents have long been divorced my dad literally proposed to his girlfriend just days ago She said yes and things are great for them and my siblings In fact I have three more little rugrats joining the family as my mom is currently pregnant with her boyfriend s third child I am still the oldest When I was years old i wanted to die But I didn t I stayed alive to protect my siblings However I said to myself that when I turn on that very day in September when my body turns years old I will end it all That is in years and I don t think I can do it I am not happy with my life I have a dead end job I didn t graduate high school I have friends which are more or less just people I hang out with and I have no concept of what my future contains But I don t want to die Yet I want to end my life on my birthday at PM on an age that is satisfactory for me Like or So far seems to be the winning number But the only thing that could possibly stop me from this is one thing A girl The brown eyed black haired girl I met in middle school She had a huge crush on me and when I asked her to dance at our graduation dance from middle school to high school she cried She even said at one point that she would marry me if we could I was too much in my own head to conceive this Hey a girl ACTUALLY likes me Cool I should date her was my thought process And while what we did throughout months of high school wasn t as much dating and more of acting like close friends I loved it But then I ruined my life by breaking up with her I just don t like her that way anymore I said When really the drama in my family with my parents divorce and my internal conflict of wanting to die was the answer I want to try again with the brown eyed girl as adults We still speak on a bi daily basis and it s to the point where she actually said I m her best friend I ve dreamed of proposing to her at Disney world after the fireworks have ended and watching her cry as she tried to mutter the words yes This is her perfect proposal A perfect proposal for a perfect wife to be But that is just a fairy tale The girl ignores me when I try to ask her for coffee or makes up some excuse as to why she can t go I want to understand and say well maybe she s telling the truth but in reality I know she flat out doesn t want to Well that s it I m resisting the urge to look over and reword the mess I spilled out over my keyboard but these are my naked thoughts I am most likely going to die in September of Anyone wanna chat,"Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Seeking Help, Progress Update, Mood Tracking, Cause of Distress","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Mood Tracking, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

Running out of options and ideasI m just going to warn now that this is going to be a bit long I m really really sorry I m I lost my mom on Thanksgiving Nov of She had terminal cancer and the entire process of her getting extremely ill and dying traumatized me pretty badly She died when I was on the way to the hospice to see her so I didn t get to say goodbye Between that and a lot of other things I also carry a lot of guilt as well as trauma and grief revolving around her death Less than two months after she died we experienced a house fire and I lost my home and four pets I had This has caused me to reach a breaking point that s just been kind of ebb and flowing since mid January I have a lot of familiarity with suicidal ideation I ve been in and out of hospitals for suicidal thoughts attempts and self injury since I was Lost count of the amount of times I haven t been admitted since but I went a couple weeks ago for a screening Only a hospital that I have very bad experiences with had beds so I contracted to safety and signed out This was over fourth of July weekend so the lack of beds didn t surprise me I have borderline personality disorder pretty bad OCD and way before my mom passed I had already had PTSD from an abusive relationship rape in my early teens I can t hold down a job or go to school and I m on disability I was in DBT and getting a lot better before my mom got sick I ve also been off my meds since February I lost my medicaid because of a mistake social security made and getting it back has been really slow I go to individual therapy once a week and I like my therapist but I don t really trust him yet Living with my dad has been my worst nightmare since I was a little kid and because of me being so mentally ill I cannot afford to live on my own and am forced to live with him now we recently moved into an apartment He is extremely stubborn extremely volatile has always been pretty emotionally abusive and sometimes physically abusive and generally unwilling to deal with giving me the extra help I need because the chain of events since my mom s sickness and death has caused me to regress in terms of therapy progress He s not obligated to because I m an adult but I just feel so stuck He is also disabled and doesn t do anything all day and often if I so much as ask him a question I don t have a license and at my age most of my close friends work fulltime so I have few options to get away I have a caseworker but so far he s useless compared to my last one I can barely feed myself am having trouble with keeping on top of my hygiene and can hardly get out of bed just typical depression things Because of my lack of health insurance and medication I have been self medicating with cannabis but it doesn t even help anymore Despite this I can t stop because I m just too depressed to do anything else Besides my cat I have little else to keep going on except hope that my boyfriend will get here and we can get away from this sand I can get a fresh start We re a long distance relationship from different countries and various things have caused visa issues with him which adds even more stress and I just feel a sense of urgency because my entire life is just toxic right now Hopefully everything will be resolved soon and we can be together at least but I m running out of hope I m currently waiting to see if he ll skype with me About every other night I reach what feels like a breaking point like right now I have never been so miserable in my entire life I feel like if nothing changes soon I might attempt again Everything else that has driven me over the edge before seems petty compared to now I m basically just fighting with myself about whether or not I should just go back to the emergency room and just voluntarily sign myself inpatient and get it over with I m running out of options and I m even considering electroconvulsive therapy If my boyfriend can t find time to skype me tonight I may have to go to the ER soon as in within the next few hours but either way I will try to hold off until at least tomorrow I just don t know what to do anymore but I also don t know if the hospital can even help me at this point,"Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Positive Coping, Seeking Help, Progress Update, Mood Tracking, Cause of Distress","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Maladaptive Coping, Mental Distress, Mood Tracking, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

"hi all,i want to start by saying i have a good support system at the moment and am utilizing all of my resources to push through this. but I have made an observation about myself and my thoughts recently. lately i have not been drinking much. and that is good. but when i do, i indulge. subsequently, i feel painfully depressed for DAYS after. the physical symptoms of my hangovers are bad, but the mental symptoms are much, much worse. i struggle with depression and suicidal thoughts when sober, but have a regimented self care method to manage it. and i manage quite well. so the spiral i feel after one single night of drinking is distressing.i know alcohol is a depressant, and i know that it does not particularly make anyone feel good. but i was wondering if anyone else feels this way after a night of drinking, where you cannot shake suicidal thoughts and feelings for up to a week. my friends are normal in that they obviously feel shitty the day after drinking, but not for multiple days. so I am feeling alone. evidently the solution is to probably stop drinking altogether, but i just wanted to see if anyone else has felt such intensity from a single night of drinking, and if anyone has any advice. from alcohol, to sex, to social media consumption: normal human experiences never feel normal. i either feel things too intensely, or i feel completely numb. i just want to be able to enjoy things normally, and to react to setbacks (like hangovers) in a perceivably normal way. but i cannot. but I am going to keep trying.thank you i just need a place to talk about this","Seeking Help, Maladaptive Coping","Critical Risk, Maladaptive Coping, Mood Tracking, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

A weird post or situation I rly need your help now P S This is for a friend of mine he s eating my head over this and wanted some advice so thought I d ask the more experienced crowd over here Great now let s get to the post So a friend of mine started to rly like this girl who lives across the world from him told me about hrs from where he lives in TZ terms but rly wants to confess to her idk why since I know he s getting rejected anyway based on his description of her and his personality Also fun fact he did tell me they ve not even had a video call until now apparently she s kinda scared abt it as far as he told me So he took it to the levels where he did write an entire essay worthy proposal letter and asked me to rate it I have no idea about such stuff so thought I could give him advice from other people with much better advice than I could give So just give any advice on whether this pseudo proposal I m pasting below is any worth P S read the thing and apparently she s already in a relationship but he still wants to try so ig that exists Hey idk why I m posting this at this time of the hour but I really want to get this off my chest before it starts to mess around my head and I die of an anxiety attack I ve probably said this about a million times in this convo of ours but ever since this started I ve probably never felt better in my life in terms of emotional state and never expected a random DM of appreciation could go such a long way in terms of having a good social relationship But I think I m starting to like you a lot Now I can t justify anything I could do for you over your bf who you ve probably known for well over a couple of years instead of trusting a dude over the internet you met pretty recently but all I can say is that what I say comes from the bottom of my heart We might be polar opposites in every aspect of our lives from food likings to music to pretty much anything But you know what I m fine with that I could enjoy anything as long as someone close to I endear loves it too and takes a personal interest in it I m ok in having petty fights over such silly stuff as long as we don t take it too seriously Does help with having social contact in my opinion but it s kinda what kept me here for so long I really don t even expect you to agree to any of this at this point I kinda have come to terms with being solo in my life but you know what I kinda want to keep talking to you Irdk why I would ve ever said that but turns out it is kinda true Maybe it s just my kinda toxic relationship with people and where I was taken for granted But just this simple talking is all that I rly love about us I rly can t ever say I can treat you like a princess like most girls expect but I guess I could do something which might be one better have one loyal subject always at your service or help and do whatever I could for you But hey I just wanted to say this and I rly don t mind getting friend zoned at this point but I still want to keep talking to you Sry if I have ever done anything wrong in the past but I just wanted to say this I rly do like and love you Just hope we could keep this forever and at a more personal level I rly don t force you to any of this but just don t walk away from my life after giving me so much hope to live life to the fullest again P S I had to format what he sent had sent it in a single paragraph so had to format it a bit So it took a bit of effort so pls do read the entire thing and give your judgement Just tell how you would respond to it or how you would improve it while sending the message over He s sending this in text form so I do feel sorry for whoever is on the other side but I kinda feel that he s sincere about it Thanks in advance If he does allow me I ll probably post up the response if he allows me to in a follow up post but might take around few days he s not immediately giving this in,"Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Positive Coping, Seeking Help, Progress Update, Mood Tracking, Cause of Distress","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Miscellaneous, Mood Tracking, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"

here s my debate for why violent video games reduce violence IRL I m having a debate competition and the motion is this house believes that violent video games lead to violent acts in young audiences so o figured this would be of some help against the banvideogames subreddit it s not too good rn most of the time we commit violent acts because we re angry or frustrated by commiting violent acts in the game we vent these emotions out in the game instead of in the real world say for example DOOM you know the drill we all like BFG division you might say that video games can culture some really toxic people but speaking into a mic and speaking to a face are two different things I have friends that literally gang up on me and ban me from their Minecraft server because they were in a bad mood the next day I had a few words to say to them and they just stood there and let me run my mouth I just didn t feel like letting them have their way so I did a thing that s why I think cyberbullying isn t a problem if you know how to treat is properly my own opinion you guys might know something I don t can someone please improve on this and post it elsewhere I m not a good writer I just started out the debate,Mood Tracking,"Miscellaneous, Positive Coping, Seeking Help"

"Hello fellow friends 😄
 
 I'm on the BPD spectrum and have discouraged (silent) borderline characteristics.
 
 There are different levels to experiencing anger. I was wondering, what are yours? And how do you express it? What's a healthy way you found to cool it down?
 
 For me I will first become silent and blame myself, ""maybe if I"" or ""If I only"", ""maybe he's just not having it today"", ""maybe I simply don't get him due to my own shortcomings in understanding"". However, I find it interesting how, when someone hurts the ones I love, I tend not to demonize myself no more in the extend I would normally do, but rather the aggressor. In extreme cases this can lead to my maximum expression of anger. I don't know whether you guys get to experience this as well? 
 
 I have written this as a reaction to another post and it illustrates what this anger would look like:
 
 ""The maximum amount of rage. it's like I blackout. I call it cold rage. No sense of pain whatsoever, pure anger. It's the point people don't recognize me anymore, because I will dissociate in anger. My field of view will become a pinpoint, I will start breathing superficially, and even lash out to the ones I love trying to calm me. It's disgusting and the insanity itself. I must say this only happened once in my life, when the ex of my sister encouraged her to mix her psych meds with drugs and alcohol and so she went into deep psychotic state for the first time of her life. He didn't even let us know what had happened, my sister just came home in that state. Then he called her and told her she's completely bonkers, instead of alarming the rest of the family. I'm shaking as I'm writing this because I know it's still the rest of anger inside me left behind. It was the first time I thought I could end someone's life. I'm extremely grateful for the fact that I didn't, but I know I shouldn't see him anywhere ever again. I try to calm myself by saying he's using drugs every day since he was like 14 yo, so in his brain he must be still a child who doesn't get it, due to development delay. But more often than not these calming thoughts don't work. He has very narcissistic tendencies. And saying I hate him would be an absolute understatement. I do get therapy now though. So I wonder whether I would be able to get to that level ever again. I guess not.""
 
 To put things in perspective: Normally I'm a shy and polite person. I never insult others, because I hate hurting them. People will even tell me I lack confidence actually and I should ""stand up for myself more.""
 
 So yeah, to end this long rant with the clear questions I started it with: ""There are different levels to experiencing anger. I was wondering, what are yours? And how do you express it? What's a healthy way you found to cool it down?""","Mood Tracking, Seeking Help, Mental Distress",Miscellaneous

Will soon be on my own with very little emotional stability Hi all I am years old No degree no job live with parents minimal independence I am pathetic I let things get this bad and I constantly go back in my head trying to figure out how I got here I was diagnosed bipolar and have been trying to work through my problems for a long time through various forms of therapy and medication However I didn t do everything that I could possibly do and now things have just gone on for far too long My parents are at the end of their rope and I ve completely ruined all of my social relationships My parents are in a very bad place financially and I ve been looking for work I ve been telling them that I want to find a place of my own to ease their burden but they say they worry about me I know it will be hard because I ve never had to do anything for myself and completely fail at being a person but it s the only solution I see to make sure that I don t burden anyone with my mental issues I don t have much money to my name and my parents are offering to pay rent but I feel like that could lead to more issues The greatest solution that I can come up with is killing myself since that would solve absolutely every single problem My parents would be hurting for a while but they have another son that is much more together than I am so they will be able to completely focus on him I won t have to suffer anymore this way and I won t be able to become a burden for anyone else I want to believe there is a way for me to be happy without making life hard for other people but the idea of suicide is so enticing,"Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Maladaptive Coping, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Mood Tracking, Cause of Distress","Cause of Distress, Critical Risk, Mental Distress, Mood Tracking, Positive Coping, Progress Update, Seeking Help"
