Girlfriend has tried to commit suicide twice in a monthHi everyone My girlfriend is an absolutely wonderful person with an absolutely horrific past She has gone through things I would not wish on my worst enemy She suffers from severe depression and bipolar Lately she has been feeling very worthless because of her job and not having a degree She was on the right track though she enrolled to go back to school to become a Vet Tech Things seemed like they were getting better But late last month she made her first suicide attempt I rushed her to the ER and she was sent to Inpatient for a few days It seemed to really do her a lot of good They changed her medication and set her up with a counselor Things were going fine for several weeks but yesterday we got back from a really nice vacation and as I was trying to go to bed she was in the other room writing her suicide note and taking about pills I had a bad feeling so I went to check on her and she was really out of it I rushed her to the ER and she will be there for a few days until they can transfer her back to inpatient I just dont know what to do She lives with me because her family is horrible I am her main source of support But I also struggle with anxiety and depression I can barely take care of myself I am also fairly young I have a decent job so I can support us both but it is so tough I want her to get help but I feel that having her at my apartment is not the best for her since I work so much I feel like im tearing myself apart worrying about her all the time And after this last attempt I am going to feel so uneasy leaving her alone anymore I constantly worry I am going to come home one day to find her lifeless,high,high

Not enough energy for emotions Can someone relate my first post here i m not exactly sure why i m typing this out but heck it maybe some of you can relate a few months ago I used to scream and cry and cut myself I had episodes where I really felt like i was one push away from just ending it all and that made me panic so much i would spend nearly hours screaming and hyperventilating in my bed I don t why but strangely enough i miss it a lot everything s so dull now I just spend all day moping around and feeling nothing except tired Often i want to cry and can feeling clogging up in my throat but nothing comes out like i don t even have the energy to cry half the time I kinda wish I could scream and throw a fit and feel something like I used to Is this a sign things are getting better or worse I don t even know what i want anymore I still think about suicide but it s more feeling it s vaguely coming and less thinking i m right about to do it,high,high

I can t do it Please help I honestly genuinely want to die The reason Life s just lost its colors it s gotten stale There might be more to it but I m too tired to even ponder it There definitely used to be more though The closest I ve gotten to doing it was to dance on the train tracks but I only ended up with a slightly bloody hand and embarrassment I feel like I m bothering people and I have friends with real depression I d feel disrespectful to talk to them about my fake shit A friend talked me out of it once but I m too awkward and cowardly to admit to him that I m not fine this time I don t want to drop hints because I consider it attention whoring I mean if others do it that s okay They deserve help If anyone asked me what was wrong months ago I would have had a ton of reasons to wish it but didn t want to do it Now I have no reason to wish it but I want it more than ever This is why I can t even ask for help I have nothing to say Well aside from school That s probably one of the main reasons but it s so insignificant and selfish that I d be a hypocrite to talk to others about it like it was a huge deal because it shouldn t be But it really is Still if I don t want help I want the easy way out I guess I have walking depression but I can still laugh and smile all day The only thing stopping me is the fear of the afterlife if it exists I go to hell and I m fucked If it doesn t exist I just wasted what isn t even half of my life and prematurely plunged into the eternal void I don t feel sad but I don t want to live either If you gave me a gun a week ago I would have pulled the trigger I don t know if my friends still like me I m probably annoying I just want some words of peace something that can give me courage and convince me to do it I guess This is the only related sub I know although it s the opposite of what I want Thank you lt,medium,high

I m patheticI know this is going to sound overly dramatic but as someone who has considered suicide since they were years old I jump to dramatic conclusions quickly I ve been in college for approximately weeks now and I ve realized what a piece of fucking lower middle class garbage I am compared to everyone else I come from a state in the tri state area and moved to NY manhattan specifically for college living in the dorms Where I m from there is no opportunity for someone like me because I am a creative and if you werent a family friend of some rich Italian family who owned a pizza restaurant in my old town then you were shit out of luck for any opportunity Now I go to an art school because believe me I m not capable of doing anything else I am fucking stupid And yes it s expensive to be here And yes I got a significant amount of financial aid and yes it s still a lot of money When I moved here I didn t come with that much money I ve been very good at limiting what I spend I only spend money on what I absolutely need On top of college being a lot of money everything here is also more costly So money goes quick even if it s only on essentials Started my painting class yesterday and got handed out the long ass materials list and knew off the bat I couldn t afford all of this My class is full of wealthy exchange students who went out and bought everything on the list without any worry of financial stability during our break time I spent hours in that fucking studio class thinking about how I m going to get all this shit and afford food at the same time I walked to an art supply store nearby and almost considered stealing some things but I didn t I left empty handed and feeling like shit On top of school materials I am practically wearing the same clothes every week because I have so few I ve resisted spending literally anything or going out anywhere if I can help it I ve heard a million different things about student loans and all that bullshit and my head still isn t completely wrapped around about what I have to do and where to do it to make my stupid fucking payments Don t really want to think about it right now but I ll do it anyways My parents are helping me out paying for tuition and shit but other than that I m on my own I m not going to kill myself right away but I would love to open my window and jump from stories down onto the sidewalk and die I am so fucking alone here and so fucking pathetic Money doesnt buy happiness but it fucking controls everything that I can t afford Fuck college fuck my painting class and fuck my stupid fucking life I should have never been born,high,high

I know what I want in life but everyone is shitting on me So a few years ago I got into producing and recording music I was stuck in a college degree I have learned to hate not in US so I didn t have to take on huge amounts of debt so I decided to drop out eventhough the likelihood of having a six figure income in the future would have been pretty much amp if I continued Since then I have been doing pretty much nothing but producing recording and engineering music But everyone that knows about this says I should be realistic about what I want and get into a different field I have gotten so obsessed with music that I spent around hours days a week getting better and building a catalog Reality is though that nobody really gives a shit I only know a hand full of people that really listened to my music and they figured that I am not the average joe getting into this because they know how long I have been doing this and seen the extremely fast pace that I am progressing at In fact the first song I have ever written and played for a few friends not telling them at first that it was my own the reaction was OMG you wrote that song You have to become a pro musician after telling them the that I actually wrote it That s how I figured out that I have a talent for songwriting My biggest problem right now is my parents trying to force me into some field I really dont give a damn about I told them that in a few years I will commit suicide if I am not able to establish myself as a full time recording artist producer The more I think about it the more I actually consider following through if I don t make the cut What really fuels all of these thoughts is the nihilistic perspective that I developed I really believe this might be the one and only opportunity to do what you want Who knows what will happen after death My parents say that I am selfish for thinking about suicide and I told them that I never asked to be born and automatically sign a contract to serve everyone else s selfish desires I also know that I don t want any kids so that they don t have to go through the whole process The only circumstance that I would ever consider becoming a parent would be if I actually achieved my dream So I don t have to get at them with that oh sorry nobody told you that you are basically screwed when you are born you don t really have that many choices in life and only a few lucky people get to live their dreams So wo man up Just climb the corporate ladder I don t believe in that mentality Unless you are physically not viable for your dream e g being a model or an NBA player I really do believe in the harder you work the luckier you get I have visited a psychiatrist and the only thing that I got was a prescription for Zoloft which I learned has nasty side effects Basically they are telling me Well do whatever you want just take these pills so that you can accept the reality you were born in eventhough you know that you hate it and are just numbing yourself with these pills I have not taken a single pill and most likely won t ever do it TLDR Dropped out of college no debt and found out what I really want to do in life Already putting in ridiculous work hours into my passion Family and friends are suggesting to go into a different direction because be realistic I set a suicide date in the future if dreams don t work out Got a prescription for Zoloft to basically numb my true self because be realistic,high,medium

I m trying so hard to get betterTo start off if I could only receive constructive comments and no I relate to that I feel the same way etc because I can t handle the weight of other people s struggles right now because I can t even handle my own Thank you I ve deal with mental health struggles for as long as I can remember My mom told me I had my first anxiety attack at age There s never really been anything bad happening in my life It s always been within me Which makes it even harder sometimes because unlike a certain event or situation you will always be with yourself and your thoughts I ve been in therapy since th grade I m now in th but I definitely could ve used it sooner I ve been through many ups and downs in the past years and I recently came out as transgender female to male which has made my life so much more complicated I lost my friends since childhood and then another group of friends I stopped going to traditional public school this year I ve self harmed been clean and relapsed I thought I was doing better until a few months after I left outpatient at the start of the summer Everyone says I ve been making really good progress over the years but I ve never been this close to suicide on a daily basis I can t deal with my gender identity I m constantly doubting wether I m trans but simultaneously experiencing crippling gender dysphoria I m disassociating really hard every day I ve experienced disassociation since middle school but never for this long or this intense I don t even recognize my face body voice or even the things I say or the way I act I feel like a shell of the person I last remember being Even taking a step back to analyze my thinking I can t even comprehend who s thoughts they are I ve stopped talking to people about the fact that I no longer experience a will to live because no one can do anything about it it just hurts others and makes me feel more hopeless I ve always felt like there s something else wrong with me that hasn t been diagnosed but maybe that s the hypochondria Thus far I ve only been diagnosed with Anxiety OCD and Depression I haven t self harmed in awhile but it s just because I know it doesn t really help and hurts those around me The only way I can describe it is that I m a cicada I have a shell on the outside that I ve shed a few times but now I m stuck in one shell I no longer exist to the outside world just the shell of whatever state of being I felt connected to last I don t even feel like a person anymore I have no idea who I am even on the deepest level I ve been on autopilot for so long I ve tried to get better for so long I can t remember a time that I wasn t mentally struggling It feels like life will never be different for me it s like that s just how god designed me I m tired of people telling me it ll get better it won t be like this forever you can keep going This is all I ve ever known Mental turmoil with short periods of feeling ok And I can t see any possible way out No matter where I go or where I run the problem is in my head I can t escape it I can only distract from it for a short amount of time I can t even remember to eat sometimes now I forget to do the most basic things I can never make decisions so I m probably not gonna kill myself anyway It s too much to plan and I know I ll probably forget something important It s permanent and drastic and I don t do well with making permanent drastic decisions I m just hoping someone will finally say something that clicks for more than a few days or I ll suddenly realize something or I ll find something that lets me see the light at the end of the tunnel Feel free to ask questions even if they re personal I m desperate,high,high
I m nothing and I won t have anything enjoyable in my life Firstly I m sorry for my bad English but I m not a native speaker So I m years old boy and I ve been planning to commit suicide for couple of months I would probably do it already if not the fact that I doesn t want to hurt my mother and my friend Maybe you re wondering why such a young lad like me is willing to do that Well I would rather ask Why shouldn t I There is no happiness for me now or in the future I think every person consciously or unconsciously is seeking for happiness so what s the point of living where there is no hope for me to be a happy man I don t know if happiness isn t destined for me or I just not capable enough to reach it but does it really matter There s is not a good thing waiting for me period Everyone perceive happiness as a different thing For me happiness comes from social interactions and from making different people happy It may sound a little bit ironic considering the fact that I have to cope with terrible anxiety general akwardness and introversion Maybe that s the reason why I want to commit suicide happiness for me comes from a thing that I m not able to do I was thinking about becoming an writer That s a way right People will enjoy my books and everything will be fine Well there s the problem I m not good enough to make it work Although I enjoy writing what s the fucking point if it doesn t reach wider public Secondly I know it my sound kind of cheesy but I don t think I can reach happiness without having a girlfriend And for me having someone like that is not almost impossible it is just impossible There are various reasons for that I m ugly and overweight I m shy and introvertic I m bad at having conversations I m kind of a weirdo I don t like generic music and stuff etc It is so painful for me that no women will ever love me it s so fucking painful man And it s really not about sex I don t give a fuck about sex I can quickly jerk off and all of my lust is gone It s about love and everything that comes with that For the end I m just gonna say wish me that someday I will gain enough braveness to finally jump off the bridge,high,high

I don t know how to dream anymore and I want to give upI don t know what happened but around the time I was something clicked in me Within a day I completely lost my ability to dream about a future I stopped trying in school I lost normal habits showering regularly cleaning my room brushing my teeth and lost all responsibility under the impression I was never going to grow up so there s no use keeping those habits Now I m and I completely fucked myself over I don t have any social skills don t have a job fuck I barely even have teeth anymore because I haven t brushed them in so long half of them are broken or corroded No matter how much I tell myself I want and need to get help I know I ll never be able to push myself to get the help I need Everything became so much worse when last year I ignored a friend who desperately wanted and needed help because I felt too awkward around someone who was just as depressed as I am and they ended up killing themselves which I ve blamed myself for for days straight and now I straight up hate the one person who was there for me through it all All I can do is distract myself from the bad thoughts by watching videos and playing video games I even force myself to take large doses of sleeping pills to the point where I can t even feel my own face because if I m left alone with my thoughts sober I start to convince myself that it isn t worth it anymore I know this is all taking a huge toll on my mother because she s forced to support me through all of this but whenever I consider if I should at least get a job I worry the added pressure will just push me over the edge I don t remember what happened to me when I suddenly changed like that but whatever it was took away my ability to dream took away my drive for living and all my passions and I just wish I could go back in time and prevent it from ever happening,medium,high

In Canada what are the consequences of making a suicide attempt and recovering LONG text sorry This subreddit is very quiet but I don t think my question would be allowed in r AskReddit r AskCanadian subreddit is very quiet too I hope someone knowledgeable can help me Please correct me if I m wrong When you attempt suicide in Canada and police or paramedics are called this event is recorded in the Canadian Police Information Centre CPIC database as well as any relevant local police and medical databases From googling I ve found out that consequences include I won t been able to get a firearms license a wise restriction I probably won t be able to travel to https www thestar com news gta canadian woman denied entry to us because of suicide attempt html or through the USA suicide attempts can be recorded in the Canadian Police Information Centre database which is somewhat https en wikipedia org wiki Canadian Police Information Centre accessible http www cbc ca news canada windsor canadians mental health info routinely shared with fbi u s customs by the FBI and U S Customs and Border Protection If a person attempts suicide recovers and is able to become mentally healthy and live a normal life what other permanent negative consequences are there Can insurance companies dig up this information Affecting extended private health life or even auto insurance eligibility Will prospective employers be able to find this through background checks Will mental health history be covered in the Canadian Government Security Screening I mean will you be treated like a convicted criminal not allowed to work with confidential information like someone who helps do your taxes or a medical office assistant transport medical supplies like insulin or donated blood or transport hazardous materials like a freight truck driver transporting a load of pool cleaning supplies Security screening focuses on your reliability https en wikipedia org wiki Security clearance Canada I can t find specific mention of mental health but I think that can be considered a significant factor of a person s reliability I also don t know the negative long term consequences of having suicidal thoughts or involuntary hospitalization in my medical record Will this also hurt my ability to get a job or insurance I m afraid to admit to anyone that I ve seriously considered killing myself I don t want to be involuntarily locked up for three months https www legalline ca legal answers involuntary hospital admission of mentally ill people and length of stay or more Years ago I had a psychotherapist who just kept prescribing different drugs which left me feeling extremely detached unable to concentrate on anything and a lot of other side effects like dry mouth I don t want that again I hated those drugs I had a very difficult time finding a psychotherapist who seemed right for me I hesitate to say this but I found some of them very unprofessional one spent all of our sessions asking me technical computer questions and essentially getting paid to pester me as his personal IT support person he was the drug pusher another was working hard on an academic thesis with a really narrow focus which he forcefully tried to apply to all of our therapy sessions whether it made sense or not He would ignore any patient problems or issues if they were not dream related and can also be drawn on paper He adamantly refused to do anything else I couldn t make this up if I tried All of this turned me off of therapy for years Canadian healthcare might be better than in the United States in some ways but there s a lot of flaws and problems too In recent days I had been having increasingly frequent suicidal thoughts but so far it s gone down and I ve been holding steady I managed to find a relative to talk to Not a resolution or even a reliable source of support but it s pulled me back from the edge Also finding this https www camh ca en hospital health information a z mental health and addiction information suicide Pages default aspx web page at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health Canada helped It s slender comfort but where the page explains why and Who is at risk and What a re the warning signs it was like a brief warm sunbeam because whoever wrote that web page understood exactly how I feel Thank you for taking the time to read all this I hope someone can answer my questions How screwed am I if there are records of me having attempted suicide or being locked up in a hospital or even admitting that I wanted to die,high,high
Is it bad that I don t want help anymore I ve come close to seeking help a few times but always stopped myself because I know getting help would probably reduce my freedom of choice probably harder to buy a gun in Canada after being diagnosed as mentally ill the only things holding me back are what it would do to my family the fact that I feel like I should be grateful for not being born in some hellhole like Africa and just pure resentment But now I have a plan to get a gun and I really don t want anything to do with anybody I want to figure this out on my own I want to decide if I want to live or die not a therapist or some fucking doctor or even my family but me I feel a lot closer to the abyss than I have in the past but want help less and less as time goes by,medium,high

Just want to share these past couple days with you allEarly hours Thursday morning my nana attempted suicide She ODed on a mixture of prescription drugs and paracetamol My aunt checked on her a few hours later found her collapsed beside her bed she had been sick and was unconscious Eye bleeding from where she knocked her head on her beside table She had rosary beads and my grandads pocket watch in her hand Two ambulances arrived and took her away There was a carrier bag of empty medicine packets A bit of background My Nan has attempted this before she myself and many other members of my family have suffered varying levels of depression at different times for different reasons My Nan turns this year She was witty active creative and thoughtful She was diagnosed with terminal fibrosis of the lungs months ago and her quality of life declined rapidly more than we had realised The paramedics on a rd attempt managed to revive her and she was put into Critical Intensive Care Since then I ve witnessed the raw shock and emotion from my family members When only weeks ago I had considered suicide again I related to her so much but from a totally different perspective Her chances of survival were next to none primarily because her lungs were too weak but there was also brain damage from the minutes she was unresponsive in the ambulance I don t know why I m writing this out I don t exactly have a point but it s pushed me away from suicide for now I understand Nan truly I do She is still in hospital her lungs expected to give out some time tonight For the brief time she was conscious and able to get some words out to us she apologised As incredible the technology and the teams are that brought my Nan back for a brief amount of time I really believe that if somebody is mentally capable of choosing to end their life especially when faced with a terminal illness we should let them go I would ve done the same There s much more I can talk about more of my nans last words all the differing views of my family some want to cover up the fact there was a suicide attempt but that just adds to the stigma This discussion is necessary Whatever I m tired Self harming still but suicide has been pushed back for another time,high,high

Posting Gnarly Space Facts Until I Run Out of Knowledge Day Hello everyone Hope you re having a nice day Remember if you have any questions or topics about space that you d like to see me do facts on I d love to hear See ya tomorrow Fact A single NASA spacesuit costs millions of dollars to make In fact NASA currently only has EVA ready spacesuits available In case you didn t know EVA stands for extra vehicular activity basically it s when an astronaut does a spacewalk The last EVA ready spacesuit was built in and it cost somewhere between million and million dollars That s right around million dollars in today s money For a single spacesuit This is because spacesuits are incredibly complex and are essentially their own spacecraft but made for humans These aren t your ordinary work clothes They have to Protect the astronaut against the vacuum of space and from intense solar radiation Protect against tiny particles moving at up to miles per hour Provide oxygen communications telemetry and everything else a human needs to survive Allow the wearer to still perform tasks and have decent maneuverability during spacewalks These things are COMPLEX And it s actually starting to become a problem NASA is running out of good spacesuits Fortunately they have dedicated to the development of the new xEMU suit which is to be used for the Artemis missions to the Moon beginning in These suits are fitted with the latest tech and will allow our astronauts of the future to do things much easier and hopefully much cheaper,medium,low
Last ditch effortWhen I was a kid I was abused by my biological dad I ve had a speech impediment my entire life that makes me sound mentally ill No one takes me seriously When I was in middle school I was relentlessly bullied On my second year of college I was diagnosed with Luekemia Unfortunately it didn t kill me My mom and dad divorced and it was so ugly After I dropped out I realized I was trans Now every day someone says something to me about how I m a pervert or a freak People online are so vile My anxiety has been ruthless since I was a child I can t hold a job because I get too scared to go in after the rd day I m years old don t have a job can t keep one I m fat I m bald I m trans I don t have any worth because I can t labor and so I m just a parasite on my dad and mom Every job I attempt dozens ive failed at Its so much When i do work i come home crying and in the mornings before i go in i get so scared I throw up But you need money to live and I dont wanna keep being a burden and pathetic I don t know what to do I ve tried dozens of medications Multiple therapists I was on disability for a while for the cancer but it ended now I m too anxious to leave the house I m too anxious to make phone calls or work or do anything What options do I even have left besides killing myself I m sorry that this is just a bunch of self pity I just tried to list things,high,high
I m not on SW anymore I will never go back to that dark place again but maybe this will help people who are currently in that bottomless gorge of terrible emotions That s the best way I d describe it it s a bottomless pit that you yourself keep filling up Once you fall down there you just keep thinking about the worst emotions outcomes etc I know because I was there The one and main thing that helped me and you hear it a lot is just do shit you love and outside of the depression situation try and force yourself to appreciate the little things in life it helped me to change my whole outlook on life Whereas I d sulk and get upset before I just laugh at it and I don t mean in a disguise the pain way maybe it started that way but now I generally don t care or end up thinking it s funny Look I m a legit ugly fucker I mean it s become funny to me after living with it for so long and changing outlooks but I can t even leave me house or walk into any room anywhere without getting stared at people doing double takes because they can t believe how fucked my face is and depending on the situation I can hear people saying cruel but sometimes generally hilarious things I d be a complete liar if I said it doesn t bother me at some level but I ve come extremely far from googling ways to kill yourself with no pain to now laughing at the source of my life s greatest pain I also just started ramping up my creative pursuits I draw write make music paint invent shit and in all that I don t even have the time to think about getting sad that s huge being idle gives you time to shit all over yourself and think about all the bad shit But the main thing I want to stress is start to appreciate the little things in life you have to force yourself at first I started off getting shaken up inside when people would stare at me or make funny faces now I ll just play peek a boo or blow them a kiss or do some weird ass funny gesticulation because once I started appreciating the fact and I know it s not what you guys want to hear in this headspace and I thought the same thing like how does that starving kid or the person with no limbs have anything to do with my current personal situation at least I wasn t dealt the being a starving kid in a rd world country card at least I can afford to do and buy what I reasonably want I m able to use all my limbs and brains how I want etc it made the fact that I m ugly as shit way less important Now I just want to have fun in life fuck wasting my and your time sulking This probably isn t the most coherent thing written because it s pretty stream of consciousness and didn t revise but maybe it ll help someone,medium,medium

Bye To Anyone That Even Cares To Take Their Time And Read ThisI know this seems clich but I honestly feel better off dead I realize I m not the only one who has had a shitty life but it s about time I think about what I want I can t even describe or begin to tell you ladies and gentlemen the trauma and violence I ve had to put up in the past and my current status is no better Maybe not as violent But the memories are still there and my life was ruined way before making this thread I had a dream before making this thread I would like to share with each individual s undivided attention As I said before I ve been through a lot of trauma I have been through heart aches violence plenty lives have fell victim in my life and resulted into me watching death do it s part I even was one of those victims or could ve been after attempting my very st suicide and it resulted in me being pronounced dead for minutes and that s being aided by medical personnel I m no war veteran or anything I simply had possibly the worse luck in this game we play called life and it s like playing chess except I was the pawn but that s just it I was stuck being the pawn no matter how hard I tried to do the absolute necessary to change my life for the better and it failed miserably over and over and keep in mind I was doing this all myself I never had a shoulder to lean on or someone to be my side and say I love you and everything will be alright I don t have anyone to talk to and no one thinks I m worthy enough of their time and never take me serious Anyways sorry for going off topic but this dream I had was a beautiful thing At least in my eyes That I was laying terminally ill in my bed in a dark room with a light shining down on me Keep in mind I am not terminally ill nor am I mocking those that are In fact if you want my opinion I rather take every disease someone has and pass it down to me because there are good people in this world that don t deserve to lose their lives I know what to expect now Someone will say well neither do you or what makes you so different from the rest of us Well forgive me for the only thing I can feel is my own suffering and hurting and not someone else s so of course I m going to feel like I m the only one at this moment with nothing to lose in which I don t and with the most pain Life will be better without me and some will not understand me And some might and even if you do show care It s not genuine Anyways I am sitting here playing with a loaded firearm I recently ripped off and stole I know some will say we can t stop you nor do I expect anyone to but you can say your worse to me and it has got to the point where if I were to recover from this I ll just use all the hurtful things said to me as left over motivation to lead me back in the position I am right now Take care to all of you and thank you for letting me say my final peace,high,high

I m only years old but I constantly think about the process of ageingSorry if this is too long I m only only according to what people say years old and even though I wouldn t say I feel old exactly I m always thinking about our finite youth about ageing and our mortality I can t get it out of my head A new song from a band I like comes out and I realise they re and I immediately start imagining myself in their shoes as a year old with a lot of nostalgia of the past and thinking about my past and my past mistakes I m inevitably miserable in these pictures I see people I like admire or love age and that induces me into a profound existential crises I m extremely scared of ageing you probably have no idea how much it scares and paralyses me I m scared of regrets I m scared of ending up a nobody I m scared of working a job I hate and that drains me emotionally I can t stop thinking about my past regrets and worrying about doing things now that I will regret in the future I feel so much guilt when I m not efficient in what I m doing I feel so bad about myself my laziness and my inability to spend long hours focused and studying I guess I hate myself for allowing myself to get defeated so easily by difficulty I hate myself for being too weak I really REALLY want this thing but I m so fucking lazy and when things get difficult I just can t pull through I want it so much that I want to cry It s more like a necessity than a mere desire The idea of having obtained this dream of mine is super motivating but having to do the work exhausts me emotionally I know at least one of the reasons why this happens meaning perhaps there are others but I m too embarrassed to tell anyone let alone publicly The past month when mom came to visit me and help me with my breakdown with difficulty I partially told her my dream why I want it and why it s so important to me and why working hard to achieve itself is so painful It s not a crime or anything like that but it s something I feel is ridiculous and laughable something silly and that demonstrates how weak I am or have become One of my fears is having to commit suicide in the future between and years from now due to an unbearable amount of regret and guilt I know I won t find any other solution but to commit suicide if I don t achieve my dream at least partially or if I don t achieve it in the time period I need to This is because my goal heavily depends on my age and it has nothing to do with a decline in my capacities or anything like that My goal is along the lines of enjoy your young years doing things that years olds are Time itself is part of the specifications of my goal year olds or late year olds hanging out with early year olds is weird and unacceptable and I wouldn t feel part of the group either I want to hang out with year olds AS a year old but right now I can t I ve already wasted so much time isolating myself for years in my room with my computer not hanging out with people my age not gaining experiences not making memories but now what I want is something slightly different And being so ambitious or demanding sometimes makes me feel bad too Perhaps I m just a spoiled kid who hasn t grown up yet and learned of life Maybe I have to stop being so stubborn and unreasonable make peace with a life without this delusional grandeur dream of mine and live peacefully where I am I know progress can t be accelerated so much I do know it but I so wish it could you don t know much this pains me Life is so painful ageing is so painful your face changing and getting more year old looking is so painful I want to stay this age forever hang out with people my age all over the world celebrate with them suffer with them talk with them know of their dreams and fears learn about their subcultures be part of the group etc That last sentence is an exaggerated and less specific version of what I actually want but yea as you see it s kind of stupid,high,high

Suicide watch after a DUI arrest I was referred to this subreddit and it is highly applicable I don t mean to deflect but I m asking for a friend He s a great guy simply he carries a lot of baggage Some context to the current question My friend is a former member of the armed forces for the United States of America His experience was difficult to accept and it s taken a toll on him psychologically He previously was an excellent athlete and now centralizes his lifestyle around marijuana nicotine and alcohol We both attend a university in a college town and returned from our spring break yesterday afternoon Last night he drove with blood alcohol concentration over I received a call this morning from his father asking me to ensure he doesn t act drastically Legal action will be required promptly and I fear that the absence of his vehicle impounded will allow him to dwell in his thoughts to a fault He owns quite a few guns and his stability is my primary concern I am staying at his household overnight and he had some friends stop by throughout the day yet I do not foresee this being a long term fix He has acknowledged the circumstances in a constructive manner yet becomes frustrated when grasping the consequences of his actions In closing he has great character solely the baggage he carries weighs him down to the point that he wants to quit his continuation and he perceived his actions last night as justification I told him he should not define himself by one night and I was hoping to acquire some knowledge from anyone with personal experience to better provide encouragement I appreciate your consideration,high,high

I am tired I am tired of trying TLDR I hate myself Trauma Depression Bipolar Anxiety I want to kill myself but I can t bring myself to do it I ll start off by saying that I most likely delete this post sometime after posting it I guess I just need to get some stuff out I am years old I m working full time in a career that I worked very hard for A job which brings me much financial security and in some ways brings me some semblance of fulfillment I have an amazing boyfriend who loves me and wants to marry me I have a few good friends I have access to mental health care and support But I still want to die As a kid I grew up in a family of alcoholics and drug users My dad died when I was years old and I grew up with many of my most fond memories of him being drunk and trying to break into the house he broke into the house twice actually My uncle then died of drug and alcohol use On top of that my mom was also an alcoholic and I suffered through years of psychological mental and verbal abuse I frequently have recall memories of my mom yelling at me about how fucked up I was Or how I was fat and ugly Or how I was a bitch Or how I was a slut I was gaslit I was made to believe for a long time that my life with my mom was perfect and I was the one making things difficult by being a drama queen My mom rarely let me leave the house aside from school or going to the grocery store Her being a protective parent did not allow people to pick me up friends or parents so I spent much of my time alone on the weekends and during summer For a long time my mom was one of the few people I hung out with and really she was my best and only friend for years she was my entire life I had no one else It was use against the world During my teenage years I began to show signs of anxiety depression and bipolar looking back on it I can see where I showed signs of bipolar disorder but I was never diagnosed I began self harming and thought of killing myself I would take copious amounts of sleeping pills to sleep and be in a fog during my school days A few times I took more than pills in an attempt to kill myself obviously it did not work High school was some of the worst years of my life I did not think I would make it to the age of years old Now I m I hate my job the job I was supposed to love so much My job brings so much stress and anxiety I no longer see why I went into the field My administration make me want to scream They make my life worse My job makes my life worse I wake up every morning dreading that I have to work My boyfriend is great but I know he deserves so much better Who wants to be with someone as fucked as me Who has baggage like I do My past affects me so deeply and affects my behavior which affects him I have few friends I feel like I am living for my boyfriend but like I said he deserves so much more I want to be everything for him but I do not know if I ever will be I feel guilty because I do have a good life but I still want to die I want to die I want to stop hearing my mom s voice in my head I want to stop being a burden to everyone I want to cease to exist and I want everyone who loves me to move on and find other better people to fill my space in their lives someone more deserving of that space I m struggling with the fact that I made it to my th year it feels so weird to have made it when I thought I would be dead by It s jarring to say the least I don t know how I am supposed to make it any further The future seems so dark and bleak Honestly I don t even see a future for myself I don t deserve to live I am a burden on this earth I just need the courage to do it I apologize to anyone if this post seems rambling I just needed to get this out,high,high

Guys this is important Cock and ball torture From Wikipedia the free encyclopedia at en wikipedia org https en wikipedia org Cock and ball torture CBT is a sexual activity involving application of pain or constriction to the male genitals This may involve directly painful activities such as genital piercing wax play genital spanking squeezing ball busting genital flogging urethral play tickle torture erotic electrostimulation or even kicking The recipient of such activities may receive direct physical pleasure via masochism or knowledge that the play is pleasing to a sadistic dominant Image Electrostimulation applied on a penis Contents Section In Pornography Section Ball stretcher Section Parachute Section Humbler Section Testicle cuff Section In pornography In addition to it s occasional role in BDSM pornography Tamakeri literally Ball kicking is a separate genre in Japan One notable actress in tamakeri is Erika Nagai who typically uses her martial arts skills to knee or kick men in the testicles Section Ball stretcher A ball stretcher is a sex toy that is fastened around a man in order to elongate the scrotum and provide a feeling of weight pulling the testicles away from the body While leather stretchers are most common other models are made of steel rings that are fastened with screws causing additional mildly uncomfortable weight to the wearer The length of the stretcher may vary from inches and the steel models can weigh as much as five pounds Section Parachute A Parachute is a small collar usually made from leather which fastens around the scrotum and from which weights can be hung Conical in shape three or four short chains hanging beneath to which weights can be attached Used as part of cock and ball torture within a BDSM relationship the parachute provides a constant drag and squeezing effects on the man s testicles Moderate weights of kg can be suspended especially during bondage Smaller weights can be used when the man is free to move when the swinging effect of the weight can restrict sudden movements as well as providing a visual stimulus for the dominant partner Section Humbler A humbler is a BDSM physical restraint device used to restrict the movement of a submissive male participant in a BDSM scene The humbler consists of a testicle cuff device which clamps around the base of the scrotum mounted in the center of a bar that passes behind the thighs at the base of the buttocks This forces the wearer to keep his legs forward as any attempt to to straighten the legs slightly pulls directly on the scrotum causing from considerable discomfort to extreme pain Section Testicle cuff A testicle cuff is a ring shaped device around the scrotum between the body and the testicles which when closed does not allow the testicles to slide through it A common type has two connected cuffs one around the scrotum and the other around the base of the penis They are just one of many devices to restrain the male genitalia A standard padlock may also be locked around the scrotum without the key it cannot be removed Some passive men enjoy the feeling of being owned while dominant individuals enjoy the sense of owning their partners Requiring such a man wear testicle cuffs symbolizes that his sexual organs belong to his partner who may be either male or female There is a level of humiliation involved by which they find sexual arousal The cuffs may even form part of a sexual fetish of the wearer or his partner However these are extreme uses of testicle cuffs More conventionally the device pulls down the testicles and keeps them there during stimulation which has a number of benefits Making the penis appear longer Pulling the testicles down and away from the base of the penis stretches the skin over the base of the penis and pubic bone exposing the additional inch or so of penile shaft that is normally hidden from view Improving sexual arousal While some men may be aroused by the feeling of being owned the physical feeling of stretching the ligaments that suspend the testicles has an effect similar to the more common practice of stretching one s legs and pointing the toes Preventing the testicles from lifting up so far that they become lodged under the skin immediately adjacent to the base of the penis a condition which can be very uncomfortable especially if the testicle is then squashed by the slap of skin during thrusting in sexual intercourse Delaying or intensifying ejaculation by preventing the testicles from rising normally to the point of no return It is much harder to reach an orgasm,medium,low

Shall I be joyous or shall I be damned Warning major long read ahead In the interest that the continuation of my life is pretty much up in the air over the next couple of weeks I ve decided to get the whole story out in the open although I doubt it will do much to help I ve never been diagnosed with anything but I m self aware enough to know when something is fundamentally wrong and depression seems like the best fit Anyway ever since I had a complete emotional meltdown during basic training for the US Army and was sent home on a general discharge I haven t been able to pull myself together with the same zeal I had when I was younger Those of you who have been through basic successfully will undoubtedly know someone like me that had everything going for them and the training isn t actually that hard but for whatever reason just snapped My family supported me well enough and the world kept on turning I brushed the incident off and started working going to college all over again Ever since my job history has been filled with initially hopeful prospects that quickly nosedive into extreme emotional outbursts that cost me my employment I spent my breaks at my first job since I returned home crying in the parking lot I was fired from the next one for punching a bathroom door in a tearful rage that struck me out of nowhere and the next few were lost due to similar over reactions that caused me to quit on the spot All of this has pretty much ruined any credibility I could have had in a job hunt as I have a grand total of ONE job that I would in theory be eligible as a rehire and I had a nervous breakdown that similarly ruined any chances I had at scholastic achievement The kicker was I could still brush this off and keep trying my grandparents owned a fairly successful business so I could live with them they raised me since my mother abandoned me and work for them and all would be fine Then out of the blue my grandmother died the day after I had a heated argument brought on by one of my emotional episodes and as she controlled most of the business details our company descended into a chaos it still hasn t wholly recovered from Sometime before this I had reconciled with my biological mother and my half sister so we came together to try and fix things and keep the company running Meanwhile my grandfather who was normally a pillar of strength and morality shook us all to the core by immediately hooking up with a year old woman down the street before we even had his wife s ashes We were so disgusted and depressed by this turn of events we decided to move to California by this point I was secretly suicidal for feeling like I contributed to my mother in practice s death so I was willing to try anything to get my life back on track but still help with the business remotely As those of you who live here will probably attest this was a bad idea We had no luck finding jobs at all not even minimum wage and next thing I know I m looking at bank statements and realize my biological mother had stolen from the business account to pay for our expenses Then she and my sister abandoned me here in a half empty house I don t have the rent money to pay for anymore successful months of credit building down the tubes it seems the business is teetering on the brink I ve alienated my grandfather by associating with them and being pretty unkind to his new slut trophy girl and here I am wondering just when the fuck everything went all looney tunes I had amazing prospects once I thought the world was mine for sure now I m in debt up to my eyeballs miles away from anyone I know about to lose my car and piss off a great landlord Part of me just wants to say fuck it all let the debt callers come and indulge the darker side of my emotional outbursts until I m put down by police or somehow become a super villain part of me wants to go crawling back and try to salvage my old life one last time to no real satisfaction and the last part says to simply take my gun wander off into the desert and put an end to this silliness once and for all TLDR No job no degree massive debt staring down the business end of a and wondering if I m pointing it in the right direction,high,high

The worst most meaningless life is still better than no life at all At least you still have the chance to do the things you love Even if it s only eating your favorite cereal in the morning watching that tv show book you love so much over and over again and waiting for the next sequel falling asleep while listening to the rain drawing at am while drinking your favorite tea etc etc I guess what I m trying to say is life is not to be seen as a whole Life is the little moments you love so much you look forward to everyday YOUR little moments MAKE life If someone would ask you what you love about life those little things would probably not even cross your mind because you see them as meaningless But then again what exactly has meaning in life Everything is meaningless Feeling content while doing the things you like doing is at least for me the ultimate form of happiness and meaningfullness And one can only be happy while alive,medium,medium

My suicidal thoughts I am typically a person who tends to internalize a lot of my problems and do not usually express when I am feeling depressed or sad However I do want to express these problems and talk about them I know I need help with this because I have obsessed over these thoughts for years now I am constantly of the mind set to judge if life is worth it or not wondering how much more of existing can I stand before I just put a bullet in my head I feel like the mindset I hold is undeserved and pathetic Some people undergo such profound suffering for these thoughts to manifest and it s almost no wonder they do But I have not suffered any great tragedy my life is easy so easy compared to most people s it s pathetic I wake up do household chores for an hour or so and play video games with my friends all day The only great stress I have is how I will manage to grow up Because it seems I have the lifestyle of a child when I am at my transition into adulthood But this is also paired with the realization that the life of the average joe that lives in a part of the world with the highest life quality is doomed to the majority of their life being tedium and suffering And that is not me just speculating I have had jobs in retail and a fast food restaurant So I have experienced working in lowly entry level jobs and going to school and both suck the majority of the time So I am stuck left wondering what the fuck do I do that isn t awful I fear my life is going to turn into a game where I pick jobs hoping one of them will be good only to realize they have all sucked and then uh oh I m real old and the majority of things I have done in life I have regretted well fuck me I guess I ll die I just feel so lost I am trying to find a path in life where I am not doomed to suffer the majority of the time and live for those small bits of time where I can do what I please I want to live for what I like all the time but I m afraid that s too greedy too much to ask for the majority of people don t how could I go beyond to that state of blissful existence Does it even exist Am I chasing after something that can never be attained And if that s the case how do I endure the suffering Because I feel like I am weaker than the majority I am pathetic when compared to the majority People have endured so much more than I have yet they still have the will to move forward when I am here wallowing in despair over the inevitable suffering I will face in the future One day I fear when I finally face my moment of profound suffering it will give me the willpower to end my life If you have anything to say please do I really want to hear your opinion on my circumstances I have kept these thoughts to myself for too long,high,high

 He wasn’t talking to me or texting me as much as he used to saying he needs to minimize phone time or he just doesn’t use his phone when he’s out or with fam or friends but he’s with them 24/7!! The phone is literally how we communicate and how this relationship works!! I felt abandoned like he just didn’t care bc he refused to compromise, we went from talking ~1-2 hr on the phone each day and like 500???? texts to like ~30 min on the phone and 100 texts a day. 
 
 I really hurt. I felt alone. He has so much time with his friends and family in person and I don’t ever get to see him, and he still wants to shorten our trip that is literally still a week and a half away bc of his concussion when he literally does the same stuff we’d be doing maybe even more when I came up. He says he needs to feel independent but I’m literally 1000 miles away and am just ducking asking for 8% of ur time every day. 
 
 He knew I had BPD from the start but I have genuinely been able to control it better than ever before until tonight. I just feel like he’s making excuses to not talk to me and not let me come up anymore, but why? You know what my mind jumps to… I believe him when he says he had a concussion but I really just feel like he changed into a different person. He went from being the perfect person everyone loved him promising me everything caring and understanding and now he acts like I’m fucking disgusting and he hates me. 
 
 Tonight he promised me that I would have a chance to call and talk to him for a while, but then he called late and said he was tired and needed to go to sleep to rest up instead but then I texted him a little later and he texted back and he had just been chilling with his brother who he sees CONSTANTLY. And then called his friend instead of talking to me after promising me!! He always sees and talks to these people he lives so close to them! He literally just acts like he fucking hates me and I’ve kept it together for a fucking week and a half and I really just wanted to fuckinf see him for enough time. 
 
 I called him over and over and he blocked me and made his cousin block me and I just SH. Fuck it. Im so sick and tired of everything. Ok goodnight.",low,medium

I can t live with this thought I feel sick During last summer I developed a sense of high anxiety around being in the company of young people babies that I d never had prior This was a result of feeling intense distress over finding out that an ex teacher was a pedophile I came to realize in March this year through research that this is called POCD which provided me with a lot of relief In the late evening of Monday rd September after having moved back into university halls of residence for my second year a week prior I basically watched pornography for around about hours intermittently when my depression was as its worst height I d already experienced false memories by this point Anyway for that whole afternoon and night I would go from grinding humping against the bed an awkward way of doing it that I developed when I was in my early teens while watching Porn Hub on my phone to then sitting up and watching random videos on YouTube The second to last video I watched was a video of Kurt Cobain and his year old daughter that appeared on the homepage after going back from Porn Hub and sitting up in bed again At this point I remember thinking that if I were to watch this video I shouldn t watch another video afterwards purely because this YouTube video had a baby in it even though I knew deep down that the two videos were entirely separated by tabs on my phone not to mention obviously by content Nevertheless I watched the interview video scrolled through the comments and paused at a specific point then went back to Porn Hub and only then did I kneel down to grind the duvet again but with a video loaded Finally I remember sitting up again and going back to the YouTube homepage and the first video shown was a slideshow of Cobain s daughter through the years and I remember feeling so much guilt for having watched the prior porn The reason for this is that as best as I can describe seeing her as a baby the pinnacle of innocence exemplified the essential humanity that we all have including the adult performers As a result I felt heavy guilt that I now realize to be misplaced for being what I considered to be anti feminist and an evil person Perhaps I overthink the morality of things I don t know My brain at the time immediately started to go into overload and overlap what would otherwise be two separate actions of watching YouTube then lewd stuff I remember going to the sink afterwards and dry vomiting With regards to the actual first person recollection of possibly staring at the Cobain video I have no explicit sensory memory of this The image in my head is grainy at best I wouldn t have been able to live with myself were this the opposite After leaving the bathroom and panicking a lot I walked through it step by step and eventually felt comfortable enough that I hadn t done anything wrong and so I left it This as a general worry didn t reappear again till May with the rest of being spent going from day to day worries and false memories I even felt happy and content on New Year s Day this year Surely if I d done this horrible thing I wouldn t have been able to feel anything happy ever again At first I wondered if I did do it and I just repressed it or I didn t and actually it s just my overactive imagination mixed with my anxiety I know that in my heart I didn t do anything wrong as I had listened to Nirvana plenty of times afterwards and didn t feel pangs of guilt or shame that I know I would ve if I d done anything wrong Things have gotten better mildly My first appointment with an OCD therapist is soon I m currently on the fourth day of taking a beta blocker to regulate my heart rate and blood pressure that helps ward off the panic attacks I have about it I m trying to sleep better but sometimes the image creeps in too much I m due to get a new set of the anti depressant mirtazipine soon too But even with that it all feels like too much right now and I m more suicidal than ever about this I don t want to die over an image in my head but is this a belated guilty conscience I feel sick and can t think or sleep I have moments of you know you re being silly start living again but then it hits my head over and and I end up in bed depressed for another week I worry that I might out of a morbid curiosity have done it I remember faintly thinking how awful it would be to do it and then as far as I know not doing it,high,medium

I feel rejected by the system and I don t know where else to turnI don t really know where to start because I feel like I ve been on this roundabout for a little while now I dealt with a fair bit of bullying and family issues divorce DV as a child young teen This made me feel quite anxious for a few years and this is where I first started with psychology It really helped me for a while but the anxiety slowly faded away and was replaced by depression I d say for about three years now I ve been really depressed It s hard to tell because you don t really know how bad it is until you re through it I guess has been horrible for me It s been difficult to do anything so my grades have slipped really badly I ve tried to kill myself four times this year all with some form of drug and alcohol It s usually messy but I guess when you re that impaired that you don t have a filter it gets a lot messier when you say things you regret to family and friends I deserve it but now most of my family and friends have desserted me too I don t blame them because honestly I ve been horrible The last time I tried was about three months ago now It was at my university campus and there were posts to the facebook student group while I was in my impaired state I didn t intend on doing that nor do I know why I did The result was that I was found after a goose chase with security and was arrested and taken to hospital Of course it was just like the other times I was drunk so they assume I wasn t really depressed and that I was horrible for doing what I did I was placed in a room and I wasn t allowed to see anyone or have my phone I had to beg a doctor for help and that was when I finally got some antidepressants I d been on them before but it was too expensive to keep seeing my psychiatrist I was finally released and it turns out I sent some pretty embarrassing and inappropriate emails to one of my favourite lecturers who I really looked up to That really made me upset by putting someone in that position I ve apologised and since haven t got a response even though I know he shouldn t have to it s a professional setting you know even though he said he s always there to talk if I need it It really hurts because even though he was purely a teacher he was one of the few people that I really trusted and I felt was there for me Depression makes you get attached to people I guess The posts were visible to everybody so whenever I step on campus I get a lot of bullying about it now too So I m too scared to go back I know my mum has had it to because last time we fought she said she was too tired of worrying about me and that I should just do it because she needs closure I know she didn t mean it but it really hurts But the worst part is the hospitals I m always treated like a criminal I m always hated by the nurses and doctors And I stress so much about previous experiences there that I can hardly bring myself to go to a doctor or talk to a counsellor just in case I say something too worrying I feel completely rejected by the medical people that are there to help as well as everybody who has said they care I ve been on these new medication for about three months now I feel less depressed I can get up in the morning and stuff like that But the suicidal urges are still here They re so strong I have to self harm just to get rid of them I m so worried about it And the worst part is that I know if I do it again I m going to make sure that I succeed because I can t deal with the hospital again I m worried that I m going to hurt myself I don t want to but I don t see any other option at this point Please help me,high,high

Not sure if it s worth it I ll explain what I mean I m at a position right now where I can improve the quality of my life but don t feel like I should The entirety of my life has completely unraveled towards recreations that include alcohol abuse a stint of prostitution shallow friendships and destructive romantic relationships This year I turned and voluntarily committed myself to a behavioral psych ward one week before my birthday I left work early one day after a particularly stressful morning filled with whispers about my lax in productivity and drove my shaking and hazy self to the emergency room to tell them I thought about jumping off the building at work I got on antidepressants for the first time in my life and tried going to group therapy one week after I was released but stopped going a short time in I m an irresponsible and angry person down to my core I do understand a lot of people aren t completely without faults but I view myself as a fault In fact my past mistakes make me feel like I m tainted in a way Like my sins have made me unable to connect with seemingly normal people I don t feel like I have many things in common with the people in my day to day life I ve had FOUR jobs in these past six months and quit after a week at each one of them I left my own place to move back in with my alcoholic and childish mother who grates on my nerves I sometimes think I m just on a path to end up like her But lately I ve found work as a seasonal worker at a department store and use that to make ends meet I ve been looking for a second job to help my finances and for me to move away from my mother Everything was okay for these past two weeks until I called in to work yesterday and today My old habits have come back and I m just going to end back up sabotaging myself to unemployment and mental anguish I sometimes sit and for wonder if I ll ever learn to be a successful member of society Will I just live a life being paranoid and irritated by daily responsibilities and fear of being with other people I have thought about killing myself for around three years lately Ever since I dropped out of high school I ve lived an aimless life I m from a poor family from the housing projects so I ve never really experienced the atmosphere of stability or success I don t know if I want to continue living a life with no prospects It feels like people tell me it s okay and things will pass when they don t realize how tired and confused I am I took some of my mother s prescription pills in her cabinet to try and sleep the day away today I think about taking a handful of them to get it over with I mean my logic has become that I m going to die eventually so why not just do it now Things are not going to improve they never do Any comments are fine I don t feel anything right now,medium,high

"Hello fellow friends 😄
 
 I'm on the BPD spectrum and have discouraged (silent) borderline characteristics.
 
 There are different levels to experiencing anger. I was wondering, what are yours? And how do you express it? What's a healthy way you found to cool it down?
 
 For me I will first become silent and blame myself, ""maybe if I"" or ""If I only"", ""maybe he's just not having it today"", ""maybe I simply don't get him due to my own shortcomings in understanding"". However, I find it interesting how, when someone hurts the ones I love, I tend not to demonize myself no more in the extend I would normally do, but rather the aggressor. In extreme cases this can lead to my maximum expression of anger. I don't know whether you guys get to experience this as well? 
 
 I have written this as a reaction to another post and it illustrates what this anger would look like:
 
 ""The maximum amount of rage. it's like I blackout. I call it cold rage. No sense of pain whatsoever, pure anger. It's the point people don't recognize me anymore, because I will dissociate in anger. My field of view will become a pinpoint, I will start breathing superficially, and even lash out to the ones I love trying to calm me. It's disgusting and the insanity itself. I must say this only happened once in my life, when the ex of my sister encouraged her to mix her psych meds with drugs and alcohol and so she went into deep psychotic state for the first time of her life. He didn't even let us know what had happened, my sister just came home in that state. Then he called her and told her she's completely bonkers, instead of alarming the rest of the family. I'm shaking as I'm writing this because I know it's still the rest of anger inside me left behind. It was the first time I thought I could end someone's life. I'm extremely grateful for the fact that I didn't, but I know I shouldn't see him anywhere ever again. I try to calm myself by saying he's using drugs every day since he was like 14 yo, so in his brain he must be still a child who doesn't get it, due to development delay. But more often than not these calming thoughts don't work. He has very narcissistic tendencies. And saying I hate him would be an absolute understatement. I do get therapy now though. So I wonder whether I would be able to get to that level ever again. I guess not.""
 
 To put things in perspective: Normally I'm a shy and polite person. I never insult others, because I hate hurting them. People will even tell me I lack confidence actually and I should ""stand up for myself more.""

Just exhausted of continually feeling this way and it s not bound to get any better The past months has been an incredibly tumultuous time for me In the time that s passed I ve experienced the following Experienced the end of my first adult love leaving me and my self esteem in shambles to the point where I believe that no one would be insane enough to love someone like me and even if they did they d just find flaws to nitpick at and leave me for anyway Lost the majority of my friends after this and the ones that remained are too far away and are too busy living their own lives to a point where I ve been reluctant to reach out to them Almost didn t graduate from college but barely got by and found myself neck deep in student loan debt Moved back home where my entire family experience is my father being overseas for a job in order to make ends meet while my mother is constantly yelling at me for one reason or another This has gotten to the point where I don t even want to leave my room to avoid her fanatic hounding Got a part time job which basically puts my degree to no use Also generally work graveyard hours but not always so more often than not I barely get any sleep at all A constantly stiff neck and upper back area caused by stress that has lead to very painful frequent headaches Basically having to go to graduate school in order to pursue a profession with my college major but doing so would require me to accumulate even more student loan debt Experiencing these same things over and over again and having a general feeling of hopelessness throughout my day to a point where I just don t want to deal with it anymore I m just so tired and I can t see this getting any better The idea of suicide has been crossing my mind ever since February in which the start of this snowballing all happened but as time passed I started leaning more towards it quietly doing my research while putting on a fake smile every time I had to leave the house and just shutting myself in my room again as soon as I got home The extent to which I want to avoid my family is so great that I skip meals just so I won t have to see them because it always ends the same way with my mother nagging at me and exaggerating the circumstances I don t have individuals I deem close enough to talk to about my worries either as my group of closest high school friends is now all over he country busy with their own careers while I feel like I ve regressed by moving back home after university and getting a part time job that requires no degree just to start paying my seemingly endless amount of loans back I did want to further my education but the prospect of having to borrow even more money is greatly deterring along with my university GPA being severely lackluster because of the way I barely stumbled over the finish line to graduate this spring I think I m at my breaking point I don t know what to do and I don t want to tolerate this anymore I know I m on the younger end of the spectrum and there s the unknown that s waiting for me or whatever but honestly I just feel like these burdens are just going to keep following me around no matter what path of life I choose to take and its exhausting and demotivating having to deal with all this at once I hate to think of using it as an easy way out but at this point I really just don t want to deal with the pain depression and stress that I have to cycle through every moment of my day,high,medium

HOOOOOOOOLY FRICK I JUST STEALTHED BACK UP TO MY ROOM WHILE MY MOM WAS AWAKE BUT ALSO PEED IN MY UNDERWEAR So lemme start with a basic layout of the house My computer is in the basement my mom sleeps on the living room couch and my room is on the second floor The stairs that go from floor to floor are right next to where my mom sleeps I was on my computer in the basement playing a game that didn t end till AM when my bedtime was AM I turn off the lights when it hits so if my mom looks at the door she can tell I m not awake The game finishes at three and I shut everything off But the moment I do that I hear my mom get up to go to the bathroom from above me I realize I lost my shot to go upstairs seamlessly Also I suddenly really had to pee My first thought was Oh god oh heck oh frick I NEED TO PEE So I began devising a plan to get to my room where there is a bathroom I first thought to wait a couple minutes to hopefully hear her snore As I m waiting I try to think of a safety net excuse to lighten the blow I strip to my underwear so that if I were caught I might have a slim chance of explaing that I couldn t fall asleep and I was getting a drink or something minutes pass no snoring I hear her shift on the couch again I really need to pee at this point it s go now or die I begin heading up the stairs and as I hit the rd to last step I hear a couple of drops of liquid hit the carpeted stairs Thankfully it really was only a couple drops I look to see with my phone light that my underwear is now streaked with urine Cool deal with that later I continue heading up the stairs and I finally reach the same room my mom is sleeping I need to pee now I quickly yet quietly walk to the bathroom that my mom just used which is right next to the living room and relieve the urge that has been there for so long At this point I think I screwed myself There is now way she didn t hear me go to in the bathroom I wait a couple min and decide to just go I walk past her as quiet as possible Quickly crouch and climb the stairs on all fours the stairs that go upstairs have a foot wall of one side that block her vision and finally get to the second floor I see my room I pretty much made it I walk to my room silently and successfully make it without her noticing Now I wait till morning to see if she really didn t notice,medium,medium

Getting to be too muchI gave up on the antidepressants I was taking about half a year ago because they made certain parts of my life dull and numb and at the time I was in a long distance relationship with a girl who was great at understanding my problems and making me feel like she genuinely cared about me About a month or so ago she broke up with me without warning two weeks before we had plans to meet because she had met someone else and she couldn t be with me anymore Obviously this hurt me and left me scrambling and aimless but I ve been doing my best not to let it dominate me and trying to pick myself back up I switched to new antidepressants a week ago because I ve been slipping worse and worse and thinking suicidal thoughts for hours every night at work or home This morning it got so bad I looked up information on my antidepressants in order to find out if I could overdose on them and I ve thought about it four or five times since then I think I m still okay because I haven t tried anything yet and the antidepressants haven t had enough time to do their work but it s scaring me more and more Look I know everyone s got relationship troubles and I know it hurts like hell I know my problems aren t special and I can t pretend they are But I ve struggled my whole life with relationships I m and I haven t been intimate with anyone And every time I get close to someone friend or romantic interest they push me away Every person I ve called a best friend cut contact with me Every romantic interest despite what they would say were not willing to actually be with me I don t know why It became a fear of mine being abandoned by people I cared about and my ex was wonderful to me for many reasons but she alleviated that fear She actually got through my depression and made me feel cared about and I felt really healthy and like I was making progress because of her And then to just be cut off again without warning to have her do to me exactly what I was afraid of happening despite knowing I was afraid of that it s like none of that healthiness and happiness mattered I mean I was suicidal before but now I don t know how much more I can take I still have immediate goals but it s becoming excruciating to get through day after day like this I just want to get over it to not feel like such a fucking failure with people and with myself and focus on other goals for now but I m not letting myself I just want to have someone close to me again I just want to feel like someone cares again Half the reason I m writing this is to just get it out of my system I think it worked because I m crying hahaha but thank you if you took the time to read it Some words of encouragement would mean the world to me but don t feel pressured to say anything Thank you so much,high,high

I don t now why I just suddenly got angry I was browsing r crushes and found a post about somebody s cat dying and her crush just saying I m a dog person and crap That reminded me of a story of my own I went on a trip to Sudan with my family we lived in this huge house because river there we were pretty wealthy and if you ever went there you now there would be multiple wild cats So there was this little cat we found in our house it was drinking some water that we had soon it feel asleep under some wood While it was asleep we took it inside our house when it was awake it was quite scared and didn t trust us but after we gave it some food and water it started getting comfy with us We kept it vaccinated it gave it shelter food and water the normal stuff for pets Until my shit sister dropped my cat she smacked it and It didn t get back up though after a while I saw it in our room on my bed sleeping next to me though we I got up it started running as my parents yelled at me to get it out of the house I refused they forcefully threw my cat out of the house she came back running to me they grabbed it again and closed the door quickly I looked for her later but she was gone And about year later My parents chose to show my a completely different cat and claimed it to be my cat I could imagine it being killed by dogs or dying somehow but MY PARENTS COULDNT BE NORMAL AND DECIDED TO SHOW ME A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT CAT And what did I do I stayed quiet because my dad would ve yelled at me or just kept trying to say it s the same cat This pissed me off and I am in bed right now with my pillow full with tears I just want to say to you pet owners out there keep em safe because you won t know how long they ll last Bye,medium,medium

TIL Nobody actually takes your mental illness and suicidal thoughts seriously even your doctors and therapists Everybody thinks you re just being immature or finding excuses for your failures The only time they realise that you re really in trouble and need supports and helps is when it s all too late You might think the professionals would act totally different But the truth is that the therapist I met literally told me to grow up and be responsible and that the doctor I saw more or less implied he couldn t help and wouldn t care as long as it s my life not his child s I m trying to gather the courage to off myself within one or two days Don t want to live through a life I m incapable of living through while nobody cares at all,high,high

No matter how many times it gets better I just end up at the bottom of the same hole and I m ready to lie in it I m now have tried to kill myself twice before which led to my year on and off again journey through therapy and mental health treatment It s gotten better but I always fall into the ditch and wonder if I should just fucking do it already and do it right this time The thought of my mom having to live the rest of her life with me dead mourning me and my choices is the only thing that sobers me from the suicidal ideations Today has particularly been a rocky day though and I feel like that grip on staying here for her is weakening I started having ugly thoughts tonight like how I was so jealous of Kobe and the other victims of that helicopter crash Or how I wish I were infected with the coronavirus and on my way out I m actually embarrassed to admit this but at the same time feel so passionately about these desires it scares me For the first time in I think maybe or years I started researching suicide methods My dad takes anticoagulants for his artificial heart valve and I figured if I steal some of his medicine and cut myself in the bathtub I can bleed out and die peacefully I have the growing urge to hurt myself permanently The only hard part will be leaving a note for my family and a letter for my ex maybe but I don t know what I even need to say to him besides sorry Still this terrifies me but excites me I just crave life to be over so often and I m getting restless No matter what happens in life I always end up in the same place I keep fighting but I m wondering who s battle is this actually I m definitely not fighting for myself anymore I ve officially given up and am just waiting for my dad to come home from a trip so I can see him one last time,high,high

"stuck for weeks hello i would like to preface this spiel by explaining what i mean by being stuck two weeks ago i had an episode before a test which i rarely if ever get i originally thought it was a bad panic attack characterized by rls heart palpitations constant perspiration and extreme issues concentrating and even being slightly incoherent the test passed i even got a good grade but the feeling still remained days after i feel it slowly going away 2 weeks after the fact but itâ€™s at a rate that is annoying since it feels like barely anything is helping 
 on the third day of waking up then going to bed extremely anxious and on the verge of a panic attack i went to my general doctor from there they prescribed me 5mg xanax twice daily as needed the alprazolam did not help it just dampened the sense of panic and i still had most of my physical symptoms 
 
 my question to everyone who reads this is â€œwhat do you do to mitigate these annoying side effects and are there any natural remediesâ€
 
 ps iâ€™m on gabapentin 300mg 3x a day propanalol 30mg twice daily guanfacine 3mg er lexapro 30mg and trazadone 50mg all of which did nothing to help with these feelings the past two weeks",low,medium

I don t know who I am anymoreThat s where I m at right now as I write this I ve been depressed for years now but the depression this time is different stronger I don t really feel down I just feel empty drained of everything that was ever considered me I rarely feel anything anymore or at least I no longer know how or what to feel Things I used to enjoy I can no longer stand or no longer get any pleasure out of I have no motivation to do anything other than sleep and I only do things because I m obligated to My personality is gone as well and the feelings I ve had for those close to me are no longer there When I call my dad or mom I feel nothing I don t feel like myself anymore and I have no idea who I am anymore I just feel like a ghost crudely occupying and controlling a fleshy shell I mean there are times when my legs or my hands don t feel like mine My cognitive ability is completely shot as well and I can barely remember things more than a day s past Just typing this is an ordeal constant spelling mistakes and typos On top of all this I have no one to talk to I have no friends to talk to Sure my Facebook profile says otherwise but I never talk to any of them online let alone IRL I can t even tell my family because I know all they ll do is worry and try to fruitlessly help I mean I sometimes go so long without talking to someone that I will forget how to speak properly even with people I know quite well I wish I had someone I could talk to on a regular basis but I ve realized this will never happen because I always end driving people away for one reason another be it my personality and mannerisms or just because they found something better Some say a therapist or counselor might help but they never have for me The problem is myself I m physically repulsive I ve seen the way people look at me and the way they behave around me I mean who wants to be seen talking to a fat greasy pizza faced creeper stache monster with a sweat problem Even if they can get past that outer shell what they find isn t any better I m a dull person The things that interest me typically don t interest others and vice versa My personality and interests just aren t compatible with most people And even with people that share the same interests I usually end up screwing things up by doing something stupid or something about me drives them away And for those that are close to me I feel like an inconvenience Maybe not so much a burden but just one of those people where others go Oh here comes THAT guy again Quick let s think of a reason not to hang out with him FFS I even feel this way with complete strangers When I m crossing the road buying groceries riding the bus or just simply standing around I just get this sense that people wish I weren t there That if I weren t their day would be better I m also an addict or rather becoming one For years I was addicted to sleeping pills and benzos anything that would knock me out and numb the mental pain Then I was diagnosed with HPPD and I stopped for awhile Then I became addicted to benzos again and I started drinking I managed to kick those for a few months but now I m back at it Every night I find myself drinking or experimenting with some new benzo Anyways I feel like I m rambling a bit I guess if anything could stop me from doing what I m planning on doing it would be if I could have myself back and someone close to talk to I want the old me back the me that had friends and enjoyed things like playing guitar or staying up until am to figure out a bug in some code And I wish I had someone I could talk to about how I feel Because I don t have someone to talk to I just keep things in and never let them out and I think I finally broke whatever was inside of me by doing so Some might say get a therapist but I ve tried in the past and it just doesn t feel genuine enough I need a friend not a therapist Some might also say to call up some old buddies from high school but again I feel like I m such an inconvenience to them Anyways come Wednesday night I have some things I need to take care of on Monday and Tuesday some final preparations I ll finally be done with this It s not that I m in any sort of emotional or psychological pain it s just that I m tired of not feeling tired of feeling like an empty shell Unless a miracle happens between now and then there s no stopping me now I ve gathered my materials and made my preparations I m just putting this here because I felt like I should at least get these things off my chest,medium,medium

I feel like my suicide would be perfectly fitting poetic justice Is that the right term This is what I mean As far as I know my school s never had a suicide If anyone should kill themselves not that anyone should it should be me It would have the biggest effect if it was me It would seem reasonable and people would be shocked but wouldn t be SURPRISED I was very severely bullied every day for years by people and about at once The teachers had never seen bullying so extreme The ENTIRE YEAR hated me and almost everyone knew it I was the most hated person in the year maybe even the school for NO REASON Or at least nothing in my control Bullying is one of the most horrible things of humanity I have been depressed for about the last years And I have very very few friends and no social life at all Having no friends damages your self esteem in every way possible I never did ANYTHING intentionally wrong to the people who bullied me I just burst into tears writing this I didn t deserve a single SECOND of the hell they gave me EVERY DAY for years If I killed myself all those kids would think She really did it and would say WE drove her to this and kids at neighbouring schools would say You know my name who got picked on She committed suicide and A girl from my school killed herself And Everyone made fun of one girl for no reason and always made a joke out of her and were so mean to her and there were always so many bystanders but NO ONE EVER STUCK UP FOR HER because they all just wanted to follow the crowd thinking Oh it s my name so it s okay to treat her like SHIT and look down on her and TELL HER to KILL HERSELF and then just go on with their day like it s nothing and now she s dead Then my death could at least raise awareness and maybe definitely reduce bullying at my school and the pastoral support would double Maybe that was my purpose after all Also no one would care if I wasn t there I would walk into our house common room and the same boy would announce my entrance to the whole crowd and while everyone silenced would shout GET OUT LARA NO ONE WANTS YOU HERE in such a sincere way They made it pretty clear I was unwanted there No one really cares about me Or maybe they all care just not enough The only way people would care about me is if I was dead Similarly I ve been thinking what if the only way to not feel bad is to stop feeling anything at all forever I don t want to stall too much so that I ve left school when I do it because then the school won t take responsibility and will be able to say it wasn t because of them I don t want the wrong people to be blamed I don t know how much longer I can go on It s like a candle is burning and I don t know how much is left of it height but I can tell from the puddle of wax on top it isn t much It wouldn t be a loss if I died and I would actually be doing people a favour,high,high

How do I go about dealing with poor mental healthThis is going to be a long post so if you read all the way through thank you The past two years I have been struggling with anxiety depression and bouts of suicidal ideation I was doing okay this past semester but these last few days have been really rough on my mental health and I planned out a suicide attempt which made me realize I desperately need help The suicide hotlines are useless and I was just denied online therapy I am a low income student so I of course do not have insurance and because I m only taking credits this semester I don t qualify for my schools mental health services I just don t know what to do I can t afford any sort of therapy I ve checked every nearby therapist and they re all over even with sliding fee scales and I don t qualify for insurance I just feel lost I don t have any family or friends to fall back on and this particular year has been awful on me Do any of you have some advice I m trying to get into law enforcement after graduation not policing so I m scared of being diagnosed with any sort of mental illness But at the same time I feel that therapy and possibly medication would really help However I don t even know where to start on that since I can t even pay for the initial appointment Any advice would be helpful Sorry for the rant and thank you for reading,high,high

Coyote in a bear trapIn September I attempted to jump a foot bridge after driving six hours to reach a bridge high enough to kill me upon impact over water I wanted to die of internal injuries less of a clean up My partner at the time cheated on me while I was in the hospital recovering and then lied to me even though he was publicly chatting with the person in question and had them plastered on all their social media I hate my state I hate the room I m in I have no room at all They put me on lithium and klonopin and the only thing it did was curb my impulse to commit suicide sleep hours a day and turn my piss orange despite all the water I was drinking I finally started taking testosterone after waiting almost five years instead having to watch my greedy motherfucker of a father die of stage cancer lest I hurt the dead s feelings After a few weeks on testosterone I had a scare in which they gave me the wrong needles retracting ones and I went to the ER with the thought I had a needle lodged into my leg On top of out of state medical bills I also have instate ones and now ones coming in for a needle that was never fucking there My insurance spiked its rates another as a big fuck you happy new year to me Luckily since I left my job after telling my boss I was suicidal and losing hours of paid time off I am now on medicaid whatever it is for young people My therapist and my psychologist don t take it though so I ve stopped taking my medications Mostly because all I fucking do is sleep It smells like absolute shit every time I leave my house and have to travel from point A to B in this god forsaken area the jobs are pathetic with pathetic pay and wouldn t give me any meaning to life except another step closer to a heart attack I feel enormously excluded from my friends ever since my transition started to show more I m not invited out anymore nobody talks to me and everyone says to just reach out but when I do I focus on them and say I m all good I would drug myself heavier and drive back out but my piece of shit car couldn t make it having been in and out of the shop more than four times in less than two months once I was out of the hospital and doing ubereats for shit pay I m filled with hate and despite all the shit I ve overcome from childhood neglect and abuse to watching my father die and not feeling shit or dropping a single tear while I watched or at his wake stalking ex s finally starting my transition I just no longer feel like it s worth it anymore I m taking up oxygen and only making the weight of the world worse Nobody wants me around except for the money I inherited I want to end it but I can t work up the guts to do it I wish there was a simpler method If I went for it again I financially and emotionally could not risk failure I want to become nothing and cease to exist I m tired of this plane I m tired of getting punched in the fucking face every time I try to open a door I m tired of being the outsider the white elephant in the room just because I m trying to be happy All it s doing is making everyone around me feel terrible and walk away despite my attempts to just be happy and encourage them because I m fucking sick of being alone I m alone now and I ve always been alone I don t foresee it changing I just need to get it off my chest because no one else will listen or rather I won t let them listen I don t want to worry them but at the same time I m trying to scream out for someone to come and help me I ve sacrificed so much for others and I ve gotten shit in return So as a coyote stuck in a bear trap do I wait for the hunter to come and kill me get attacked in some new buttfuck way by someone I decide to trust because I m so lonely or do I chew my leg off and bleed to death on my own terms I have no purpose I see no purpose Except for going to school just to probably fail like my father said I would or end up in debt up to where the noose is I hate this world There s wonderful people in it I believe a lot of people are inherently good but I m just a cancer clinging onto it,high,high

How do you describe how bad you feel xpost from r getting over itI am AWFUL at putting how I feel into words A lifetime of trying to hide my mental illness from others and distract myself from how terrible I feel has left me with an inability to explain it to others and a skewed idea of what normal is amp nbsp Long story short I was diagnosed with Major Depression and General Anxiety disorder at I m now and was later diagnosed with Chronic Major Depression Recently I was rediagnosed with Cyclothymia like bipolar lite I guess which I had never even heard of My new psychiatrist said that the S S R I s I ve beem taking most of my life are like fighting fire with gasoline Shit I think this could have been avoided if I knew how to identify my symptoms and talk about the specifics of how I feel amp nbsp Anyways the main reason I m asking is because I had to bail on another social thing this weekend because I was having a can t even get out of bed to feed myself kind of day My boyfriend was concerned and a little upset that I didn t go with him He stopped by and could see that I obviously wasn t going to be able to go but assumed I was sick Like not mentally sick but the kind of sick that makes sense to people who haven t had a mental illness amp nbsp When he was asking what was wrong I was at a total loss about how to explain it to him I ve had some really intense suicidal urges lately but I ve chosen not to tell him about that for a number of reasons I ve only told my therapist and psychologist Once someone knows my dark secret it will color how they see me as a person for the rest of our relationship I don t want any of that and I also don t want people to walk on eggshells around me Also I just don t think I have the courage to say Oh I ve just had a nonstop loop of intrusive suicidal thoughts for the past months that has left me beyond exhausted and hanging on to my sanity by a thread out loud amp nbsp However feeling suicidal isn t the only thing I m feeling right now that hurts I just don t know how to explain it in a way that other people will understand or in a way that doesn t make me sound completely nuts amp nbsp When I try to put words to how a rough day with depression cyclothymic whatever the fuck i really have feels it ends up sounding really weird and vague and not something I d want to tell other people who don t get it a k a basically everyone amp nbsp It kind of feels like a constant stream of painful disgust that is welling up in my chest and neck and head The only way I can think of to describe this feeling sorry this is about to sound super weird is like imagining there are worms thousands of them churning inside my chest and throat It s beyond gross it s inside me part of me I can feel them wriggling but there is absolutely nothing I can do about them So I have two choices ignore them the best I can and distract myself somehow by getting high as fuck unconscious or sometimes games or movies will work short term or think about them and completely lose my shit because it s so confusing and horrible amp nbsp If I choose the distraction route everything gets foggy it s basically impossible to think deeply about anything I either get monkey mind and feverishly flit from one superficial thought to the next or get really dissociative and spaced out Everything aches and feels heavy moving feels like trying to walk upstream in a strong fast current I feel ugly and angry and worthless and like a genuinely bad person who needs stay hidden I want everyone to just fuck off and leave me alone because it s impossible to explain how I m feeling while I m feeling this way Not being able to convincingly tell people that I can t handle anything outside of my bedroom today without lying just adds another layer of shit to deal with amp nbsp So anyway if you re willing to share I d love to hear how you describe how you feel It can be how you describe it to yourself or your therapist if you have one your friends significant other whoever Don t worry about sounding weird you might end up striking a chord with someone else or coming to a new realization if you re brutally honest I really think being able to put words to how we feel will help us feel less alone and help gain insight into our symptoms amp nbsp TL DR Words are hard especially when you re mentally emotionally whateverly compromised How do you explain how you feel,high,high

I just feel like there is no point delaying the inevitableI ve graduated from one of the best universities in my country which I d got accepted with a scholarship and national degree in university entrence exams I ve graduated with gpa score I ve gone to Sweden with Erasmus programme I ve played in a great band for the first years of my university life had been selpt with women which I had a serious relationship that last years with of them I ve graduated and got accepted for the graduate school that I wanted and currently I am studying Game Technologies My first ever game had got downloaded by million people during my first job experience This year at th Februrary everything was changed My girlfriend dumbed me for a fuckboy my parents got divorced and they were very verbal to me about this topic I had to swtich jobs because I thought I was underpayed and being used there and now I am working in defense industries totally different industry that I d imagine for my career I dont know I think I ve accomplished much during my school years but whenever I look back I say to myself I could do better I could do better if I was living in a different country I could do better if I didn t waste my time on two long serious relationships I could do better if I decided to study abroad and just accept my parent s offer to pay for it I didn t want to make them pay for MY education I could do better if I didn t have a girlfriend when I was living in sweden with eramus programme I could do better if I didn t stop making music or writing poems and stories I could do better if I didn t take the job at defense industries so early that quitting the job means getting banned from the best paying sector in Turkey Everything I did seems like a failure to me And worst of all I ve gained a lot of weight my self esteem is on the ground I just stopped believing myself or in other words I stopped lying myself about I can accomplish anything Anyways for people around me I am a succesfull mature intellectual functioning person with interesting hobbies But inside of my mind these things just doesn t matter I was so pumped by my parents my friends and my girlfriends nothing I do satisfies me and I am feeling like I am slowly losing all my skills social artistic general etc I dont add value to anyone around me Noone needs me Noone craves for my love needs my support needs me around them I was such a nice guy to all my friends and lovers But in the end I was the one who got screwed up by them I can not seem to get laid nowadays if you exclude some of my ex gf s that really affects me because I was used to have a regular sex life and boy it was great I cannot meet with new people and make them like me like used to I could sit on a table that I know only one person at that table and carry the conversation for hours but now I am just struggling with even answering the basic questions I used to have strong believes about life politics relationships I m an atheist and know I realize that these believes just made me loser in the end and I cannot change them because they are infused into my mind Turkey is a very depressing place if you have at least slightly above the average intellectual capacities and I feel like I am trapped in this place where people are sooo terrible muslim heads who long for the glorious days of ignorance and bigotry of ottoman empire wannabe highly cultural social media slaves plaza workers bigheaded academics who doesn t give a shit about their thesis student women who satisfies themselves with shallow relationships or expects irrationally much from men people who cannot appreciate a good company and keep expecting a personal benefit from every relationship they have Fuck I am so overwhelmed trying to describe the state of mind I am in I am so sorry people I wish English was my mother tongue but it isn t and I am not confident the way I express myself This life is too complicating too demanding too shallow and most importantly too worthless especially in Turkey I want to leave here but I don t know if I can find the happiness and peace in another country Here I am an intellectual succesfull computer engineer outside of Turkey I am a fucking roach I ve sent my cv to a lot of places outside the country Noone wants me How do I escape here Should I escape here and leave all of my successes and failures behind me and start a new life Would it worth the effort I don t know Death seems like such a sweet release to me I just want to die naturally at this moment in an instant I had enough I had my peak at this life and I am just slowly going down to a horrible end I can feel it I ve been depressed before even got some medical treatment for it It doesn t feel like being depressed at all It is just there is no meaning in anything at all We are bunch of atoms Dying will just stop all of it I wouldn t care for anyone and anything If I was dead I wouldn t be upset about the fact that I could do much have children and stuff Dead doesn t care Dead is dead and for the last month I just feel like there is no point delaying the inevitable,high,medium

The thought of the end is the only thing that makes me happy I m not entirely sure what to say I often find myself lost for words but now I need them more than ever I have been depressed for a while now and I have tried oh lord have I tried to get rid of it to make it disappear I no longer think I have the capability to be happy it seems almost impossible I m going to apologize in advance for the inevitable essay but this is my first post and I have a lot of things I need aired I need someone to hear me to listen to me before I explode First of all my mother died when I was she was and died suddenly Obviously there was a lot of heart ache sadness and so on the stuff you would normally expect from anyone who loved their mother My father worked away so my sister and I never had a stable home sometimes we lived with my Nan and Grandfather other times we would stay with my Auntie and then occasionally my other Nan would look after us My mother s mother was a wonderful person I finally allowed myself to open up to someone and she took me in with open arms She was the only person who would tell my father when he was wrong She died when I was To this day seeing my Grandfather cry was the most heart wrenching thing I have ever witnessed I then found a wonderful boyfriend he treated me like I was everything but of course my best friend didn t like sharing my time with someone else and then she left my life too I still miss her It was at this time that I had noticed that my eczema had started to get worse and nothing was curing it I took my skin problem to a doctor and was referred to a dermatologist He was baffled and had no idea what it was tried different tests and treatments but to no avail Since then I have been to various doctors around the UK travelling far and wide to seek treatment My condition got even worse my body was is covered Itchy and sore Later that year my uncle died and then so did my Grandfather I started to think it was all my fault and that maybe I was a curse to my family I tried to commit suicide three times and carved the shit out of my thighs I stopped eating properly because I thought I was enormous I weighed kg My boyfriend could no longer handle me I was erratic and self destructive He left after two years of suffering me It was at this point that I had really decided that life wasn t for me I was in pain all day every day because of my skin I had to leave school after my GCSE s because the pain was unbearable and I could hardly motivate myself to leave my bed I then got diagnosed with a new illness called Myasthenia Gravis for those who don t wish to Google the disease it is simply something which makes your muscles incredibly weak to the point where it is hard to walk eat and sometimes even talk I am now on steroids which is helping but the condition isn t curable I am just hoping that it will go into remission someday On top of all this I had to look after my year old sister since my grandparents were no longer around to do so Huff I am starting to feel like I am writing this for the wrong reasons I feel like I m writing a sob story and that wasn t what I wanted I ll quickly explain what happens after that I decided to get myself better mentally tried so unbelievably hard finally felt like I succeeded got my boyfriend back after a year of trying moved out of my house and into my boyfriend s parents house because my father was verbally abusive and kind of got my social life back on track But here I am now Back where I started Rejected all of my friends again Too afraid to leave the house My boyfriend is wonderful but I feel like he can t give me what I need I sit here every day feeling like there is a massive empty space inside of me I m desperately trying to find something to fill it but there is nothing I want nothing from this life anymore If I knew that I could die tomorrow without hurting my boyfriend or my sister I would do it I would end it I have no one to talk to because I am too afraid of losing my boyfriend again and I don t trust anyone else I am poor as shit because I had to leave school because of my illnesses and couldn t get a job for the same reason The government is also unwilling to help at all I am now kg heavier than I was before because of my medicines and I feel like an elephant I am terribly unsatisfied with the way that I look I have seen a glimpse of happiness and it is totally not worth the effort This sounds incredibly gay I have no idea who I am anymore and I am so scared for my future I just want to curl up into a ball and fade away I have tried to leave out my father in all of this because even thinking of him makes me angry however I will tell you this that man can go to hell for what he has put me through I am not living I m just wasting time TL DR Was depressed then happy ish and now I see no point in living,high,high

It s beating me down I m years old In th grade I have pending drug charges from when I was caught with mg Adderall pills at school in September In January I landed myself an ambulance ride to the hospital after a shroom AcO DMT experiment with two other friends which is going to cost my parents a tremendous amount of money I feel fucking awful putting them through all of this bullshit I disclosed my past regular drug use to my parents Weed Adderall Xanax Tramadol Oxycodone Hydrocodone mushrooms LSD i NBOMe coke DXM I fucked up I wasn t doing it to feel happy to escape reality I was just curious I guess and had other friends around me who were curious as well I never partied did everything alone or with small groups of friends in good environments but I can t help but think I ve permanently wrecked my already flawed brain chemistry I m gifted and diagnosed with ADHD OCD and GAD at age I ve completely abstained from drug use and the fact that I haven t even considered using anything makes me feel as though I ve done everything to myself completely by choice I feel completely overwhelmed with guilt and I am disgusted with myself for putting my parents through this The amount of adderall I possessed when I was caught implied intention to distribute not to mention school grounds and a felony will fuck up the rest of my life if I decide to continue it I m nearing the edge and though I m surrounded by my loving family and plenty of close friends there s some driving force telling me none of it matters and to end it already,medium,high

I want to give everything and expect nothing in returnI ve been battling depression my whole life I m years old now and I feel like Atlas holding up the world on my shoulders and my shoulders are finally buckling I recently broke up with my gf the first one in my life after about a month of dating Told her I loved her she said she never wanted a family or to get married or settle down anywhere We agreed to remain friends but stuff happened and she was forced to cut me out of her life Got back in touch with her again and she still wanted to be friends and she even told me she loved me the other day as a friend but her actions say otherwise I ve given a lot of support to her and all I get in return is I need space for a while She does have problems of her own which I understand but what she s doing I ve never had someone who claimed they loved me do these things to me I feel totally alone I ve lost someone who actually understood me I don t want to bother my other friends push my problems on them The more I think about it the more I want to give up I feel unattractive even though I try to take care of myself I feel so horribly broken shattered into a million pieces that can t be glued back together again I feel so unbelievably lonely which is my greatest fear in life I m also a giver to a fault I always try to give my all to others to make sure they re happy over myself I wanted to become a police officer to help people I was thinking about becoming a living donor for Christmas giving part of my liver and some bone marrow to someone else in greater need but it s so much easier to just give everything The more I think about it the more noble it sounds in my head end my life so dozens of others can live out theirs with a new heart new kidney new liver I always wanted to save someone s life and I feel like the last two weeks have been leading to this I feel like I m at the end of my rope now like there s no more time left Like my life has been leading to this moment I don t want to do this but I don t think it s possible to live happily anymore I think that time has come and gone I really don t want to do this to my mom either since we re super close but I feel like all my options have gone out the window and I m closing in on this I m seeing a therapist too but I know if I say anything to her she ll call someone they ll take me away and then I ll never be able to become a cop if I m able to work through this I don t know when I m gonna do it but I think this is the closest I ve ever been to ending it all,high,high

My current greatest love that I had just broke me This is a thing I made on why I liked her and the last part is added just now She was the one with the idea to date she made the first move It s always a great thing when the other makes the first move because half the job is done I guess Someone who s smart pretty has her glasses just a little crooked ya know someone who doesn t go for a guy like me Scout talking about Ms Pauly She s different in a good way by making me get butterflies we always have a laugh and shooting the shit pardon for language we interact like I ve never seen before From all that I ve observed and all that I ve done myself I ve never had the kind of interactions we have She isn t the most stable person but then again who the hell is I ll admit I m not always She s more human i guess she s kinda country and she has that way I don t know how to describe it because its never been in my life before She makes me just smile I don t know if that s what love really is because it s always subjective but if I care about someone as much as to write why I feel this way and offer myself to contribute to their furthering of their happiness then maybe that s it It s just too bad she doesn t see me this way because I feel like if she took steps to get herself to happiness and I felt she was happier with me because she had the calm she wanted and she just seemed more open and happy with us together I just want her to be happier and for her to give us another shot No one has made me feel this impacted by such a loss no ex has made me feel so well shitty maybe the alcohol didn t help that evening and the massive hangover the next day but sorry God damn do I wanna change her happiness and us I want us to have both the emotion and our friendship where we can cuddle and laugh at a literal bucket of chicken when we can talk about sex and then make fun of me having an erection from talking about it It isn t possible though at least before she is happy again I know she said yes because she wanted to make me happy and she wasn t as happy as she wanted I wanted to make her happy and I was pretty happy I wasn t sure why that is but I just think its because of her mental stuff which i can t fix I m not Hercules I think you mean Hunkules I m not a god I wish I could help but sometimes I can only listen But she sometimes won t want me to listen because of her boundaries Her boundaries are what I guess bug be about our new change not the sexual boundaries but the emotional boundaries that are reset due to the mental hospital s somewhat manipulation I hate using this word so sorry but convincing her that us was bad Bad grammar She likes another guy now which just broke me I m crying in my bed right now and feeling just sick in my chest and stomach and it just sucks I just want to end it and think to myself who the fuck cares and I know people will I just sometimes wish someone would ask me about this whole thing,medium,low

i dont know know what to doi hate saying this but i don t know what to do i am and in my mind i am thinking wow how pathetic i m of course i m suicidal and seeking attention but i have felt like this since i was a little kid but even worse now my mom always yelled at me about how i m going to grow up to be homeless and a failure all just because i didn t do a simple chore i was always lazy and shit i m so weak why am i complaining when there are other people getting abused and neglected constantly and i m crying all because my dad called me useless and i can never be serious in front of my friends so they ll never believe me if said i want to kill myself all i want is to be happy again my hobby is cooking and usually do that when i m in a good mood i stopped cooking for a month and i would stay in my room locked up and only get a few hours of sleep and then miss school my parents noticed i was being weird but the thing is i don t think they believe i could ever be depressed either that or they just don t know anything about mental illnesses i can t really self diagnose myself but i did stop eating and i didn t want to talk to anyone and i didn t laugh or get angry all my grades in school dropped and that made me feel even more horrible my dad asked me if i was getting bullied but i wasn t and he said that s all he could think of i know they care for me but it s kinda hard to believe that when today my dad yelled at me and it s usually my mom who yells at me but he said you are not an adult and you can t just do whatever the hell you want you keep giving us an attitude and i m sick and tired of it he said a whole lot of other stuff and i know my parents work and shit just to come home to keep my brother and i happy it s just that you can t buy happiness and they keep doing that they buy me whatever to keep me happy but it only makes them mad and i don t want them to just keep giving me shit because i m trying to make it easy for them but then they get mad and call me spoiled and make me feel like shit i want to talk to them but every time i do they just say what because they are old and they can barely hear so i speak louder and then they think i m giving them an attitude and then they mad at me and then i can t really tell them how i feel they refuse to get hearing aids or at least something to help them hear they are always mad and keep disappointing them they are both old fashioned so whatever is happening to me they don t understand i just don t know if can live like this no one can help me i m stuck here thinking i m a failure and i am i want to die every person i talk to tells me it will get better but how can you say that when it just gets worse i even managed to cut myself and it didn t hurt it did but i didn t care i don t know why i cut myself why did i cut myself today i don t know what s wrong with me,high,high

It feels like it s creeping up on me not sure how much longer I can go on with it It s been exactly a month since my mother died at the age of I always considered myself to not have to worry about the scenario until I was in my s but here I am dealing with it at the age of I ve been criticized and pointed out at how well I m coping with all of this happening for me but deep down inside I m hurt like the rest of them I m just desensitized from all the quarrels problems and depression leading up to it not to mention nightmares almost every single night since then It used to be just my mother myself and my brother all living together My father left because of a relationship dispute some time ago when I was younger but he has still been there for me But since this has all happened it has felt like nothing but control over the situation He doesn t want to support me and my brother financially while he s the only one with a job right now and he can t support us socially because he lives in another city The most he s done is tell us to get a job and start manning up to the responsibilities that my mother used to take care of but to be fair neither me or my brother have had the willpower to do anything since I want to go and see a grievance counselor with my brother but procrastination depression and anxiety has been getting the better of both of us and I doubt my father would be willing to help in that regard I feel really broken right now Unable to work and keep up in today s society Everyone s pushing us forward telling us what to do how to do what we need I feel it s only a matter of time before either me or my brother hatches an idea and it plays out like some sort of dramatic movie I asked my brother today how is he feeling today on a scale from being like any other day to being that he knows today is his last He replied I replied although that s probably just the desensitization talking and I m probably more closer to or I feel like this is all revolving around money It doesn t feel right at all especially considering that my mother used to get paid spousal support and she d spend that money on me and my brother It now goes all back to my dad and haven t seen anything since I ve tried speaking up against my dad about this but the most he does is hold what little he supports us on right now over our heads and asks if we want his support or not I don t know what to do anymore I don t know how to live I definitely don t know how to help myself A lot of these things I would have asked my mother to hold my hand and help me do them She would give me so much support through it until I was able to do it myself but now all I get is tough love,medium,medium

Countdown to the end journal night three Hello to anyone who might take the time to read this I know this is a cloudy little corner we re in Not many come here it s not the most social place and that s ok I ve only got three technichally two days to go and i m not going to let the lack of human contact dampen my spirits I figured for tonights entry I would share a little history about myself Its far from complete but it s a start If anyone should feel inclined to they are free to message me and ask whatever the fuck they want i m an open book now I m a year old ex college kid I live in a tough town not many people ever make it out or go to college I studied psychology and theology and I always wrote a lot My parents had high expectations for me growing up but inherited my mothers susceptibility to mental illness and my fathers addictive personality I have been very prone to depression and extremely prone to anxiety issues for as long as I can remember When I was a kid before the depression took hold I had extreme anger fits I would get so mad I would scratch myself with my fingernails underneath my shirt until I drew blood Then my parents caught me and punished me so I switched to destroying things which led to more punishment which led to internalizing these feelings completely which led to this overwhelming all encompassing blanket of dread and depression In my teens I was thin and good looking I ran a lot and lifted nearly every day The feelings never left though I used a lot of adderall in high school it made it feel good to be alone read study write and do my school work I graduated I did some college Work Work Work Im skimming over things but you get the jist,medium,high

Dark Realizations Planning for the futureFor a long time I have been teetering on the living vs dying debate Obviously I want to live but at some point it stops being worth enduring existing Responsibilities offset this and delay death but when those responsibilities expire I don t see the point of living any longer Yes there are experiences I have yet to have Yes I could have happy days or even contentment but at what cost I don t want to go through life in a medicated stupor in attempt to offset the remnants of an evolutionary advantage I m not interested in self medicating either If I live I want to live in sobriety and awareness I don t see much point in existing unless I m living for the benefit of others Martyrdom seems like a silly reason to go on existing There is always the selfishness argument but at some point there must be a threshold where you ve done enough and clocked in enough time I am definitely not at that point yet but I will be and I know it So when that time comes what reasons do I have to live I can look back on my life and see happiness and regrets I can think about what will become of my survived loved ones and create narratives where they suffer and grieve but that grief won t be about me It will be their own regrets They ll wonder what they could have done differently and what could have pushed me to that point all the while knowing and understanding my struggle They ll regret being self absorbed like we all are and wish they could have done things differently but they can t and neither can I Some may carry it longer than others and I ll do my best to write heartfelt notes of absolution so that they understand that I finally crossed the threshold and that it isn t their fault I ve had practice at that I ve written them on separate occasions but someone s need always overrode my need to die I wish I would have died years ago I m already late I ve already lived too much and too long and brought even more suffering upon myself and those around me Yes there has been happiness I m not denying that but there isn t enough and I have no means to facilitate more happiness in my life I am and have been emotionally destitute for quite some time and I m tired of it The joy I have in my life is illusory and deluded I create narratives where things are different I immerse myself in these narratives to convince myself that I am needed and that the world is better off with me here It isn t So what do I do How do I stop this I am not in any imminent danger but I have a strong sense that it will happen I don t have any dreams left and I want nothing from the future I am not looking forward to anything and every activity of my life is simply passing time until the inevitable end I do not dread this end but I feel the need to test this accepted reality against the harshest of critics Thanks for reading,medium,high

It s ready to go It s just not the right place I m sat with my end plan in front of me Healthcare professionals have told me it s foolproof I could be gone in two hours The only thing stopping me is I m currently staying with my parents and it s unfair for them to be the ones to find me I could be gone within two hours and I just want to not be here anymore Childhood trauma fucked me up Being raped when I was a kid has fucked all my chances of being in a healthy relationship because eventually people get sick of me not being able to fake a smile and realise that no matter how happy they might be able to make me it never lasts I ll be back into a rut where I can t get out of bed or shower or drink water or eat Drugs used to help me escape but I m just not wanting a temporary escape I just want out The last time I attempted I didn t succeed and I was in a much better place back then I wish I could be as fortunate as I was then but I just keep experiencing trauma and I can t be fixed anymore Multiple therapists have had to give up on me because they just can t help Antidepressants haven t ever worked I ve been on fluoxetine sertraline mirtazapine citalopram and venlafaxine Nada No help I stuck to docs dosage schedules I ve had doses raised I ve tried different types of specialist therapies and nothing works Nothing can stop the shit I m going through because it s not possible to change The pain is intolerable The flashbacks are intolerable I dissociate so much I m missing out on all things important I keep getting told things will get better but without fail life just gets harder and harder to cope with I don t think I m going to see the end of the year through I guess year old me was right I wasn t going to live past the age of after all,medium,high
A good life isn t meant for everyone some people have to suffer can we live with it Is it worth it Laurel Is what worth it Life is it worth it I don t know what kind of question is that I guess sometimes it can be and sometimes it is not but the times its worth living make it ultimately worth living I don t understand why it hurts sometimes One moment I m okay and then the next I am contemplating being alive It sucks I doesn t make sense that this is the life I got It s crazy how some people have it better than others and don t have to go through the feelings of loneliness not being able to connect with people having family that is only their cause they are your family Knowing that if you weren t related to them they wouldn t care a damn about you Having people not see you as someone that is worth it Being used and thrown away when it s convenient I m not living a life that everyone else is living I ve learned that people will use you to satisfy themselves whether it be family friends or significant others I don t even get to live to the lie of believing that some people will genuinely care about me I know how women are I know how friends are I know how family is Maybe I ve been given shit examples or maybe I ve been given the best ones Cause now I know I know that for some reason I am different whether that be for better or worse I don t know yet as of know it has been for the utter worse I m only At least that is what I say to make myself feel better People say that their teenage years were the best years you get to live carefree do dumb things you get to live Yet I haven t done any of those things I have always felt alone always been the outcast I haven t got to experience life I have just been waking up day by day hoping tomorrow will be different but its not I still wake up hoping that maybe today will be different maybe my life will change today I have been thinking that since I was in middle school and nothing has changed As I ve aged it has only gotten worse My new experiences have turned out to be tragic lessons I went through a severe depression period the third nine weeks my junior year for reasons I still don t understand Is there something wrong with me There must be right Why can I not be oblivious to things why do I always have to face the reality of the situation I can never trick myself into feeling better about a certain situation I always realize exactly what it is that got me there exactly the reasons for why it happened For example I met someone I felt like I connected with her we had a freakishly lot of stuff in common I felt like okay finally I get to have my person to get close to romantically then boom its was over in less than months It went to shit A damn pandemic hit I just lost her Instead of me being able to oh well its life I fully understand why it even happened in the first place I was used I was the rebound she had her friend group trashed by her ex she wasn t even over him she just wanted to forget she just wanted to hope things would go back to what they were with him She never wanted to like me she felt she had to like me Basically went cold turkey on me Am I not worth talking too You don t even care to know if I m alive I never could understand this and I still don t understand this So I ask a question do you even like me Seen but no reply What do I do I m hurting again Except I know what is best for me I know to leave Its what I m best at Severing the link I say I can t do this I really do want someone to at least like me in a relationship What do I get Text Although we are similar The more I got to know you the more I knew we wouldn t last and that s nothing against you Why do I even bother It s not worth it I felt terrible Not because I broke up with her I felt terrible cause is that is how she really felt Could a girl say we are alike but still not even like me How does that make since How is that even possible So many questions and I just wanted answers Yet I was so insignificant I couldn t even garner a response None to my text None to my phone calls Nothing Not even a drop in the water Why even bother Dodged a bullet anyway but maybe it should have hit me I do what I do best I delete her number and hit the forbidden key unfollow That was months ago What s the point anyway What is done is done I was what I was and I am what I am No sense in changing it only finding better ways to cope with what I am Who I am Maybe it was never meant for me to be regular to be like everyone else To experience what everyone else is experiencing Friends Family lovers experiences Maybe it was never meant for me I want to continue writing maybe I should I could write about how my good friend hooked up with another friend girl of mine and hasn t talked to me since I initiate contact every time but its been over a month and he hasn t even wanted to know if I m alive What the point So many questions At why do I have to go through this now Why do I work my ass off to get nothing in return I m in the best shape of my life I have a source of income couple thousand saved I still feel in the same place I feel worse cause I achieved but why am I still in the same place Why am I choosing to live everyday only for tomorrow,medium,medium

Advice on getting drunk for the first time This may sound a bit vanilla or jokey or whatever but I got properly hammered for the first time ever last night at Overall the experience was enjoyable but I thought I d share some tips from the experience as underage drinking is very common these days Definitely do it in the company of adults and in a safe place Amongst friends in a field is a very very bad idea Make sure the majority of people there have experience being drunk so they know recovery mechanisms or how to deal with you should something go wrong Make sure you have multiple options for sleep so that should you not be able to return home there are other options be it a friend s house or whatever That s the major points out of the way if I think of anything else during my current recovery I ll update this later,medium,medium

Plans If you would like to hear my plans for suicide I have two and they are both flawless I am actually proud of this one So first pour a energy drink into a blender then add mg of Vyvanse mg of paliperidone mg of Zoloft then blend it all up After blending this up I put a noose around my neck I drink the cocktail and inject a epipen epinephrine into my neck then hop If you are unfamiliar with these medications basically Vyvanse caffeine and epinephrine are all stimulants that will when taken together in such quantities will destroy my cardiovascular system The anti psychotic and depressant have known adverse reactions The second is much simpler Fill the bath tub with flammable liquids and maybe some solids to keep it burning Then submerge and ignite,high,high
Alone depressed and anxious Nothing brings relief I m in what should be the prime of my life This means I should be beyond being neglected hitting puberty being a teen being rejected being in high school being bullied being in college finding a job being something losing a job losing family being institutionalized going through the rehab system I should be beyond all that because I have a new job I changed my routines I sought help I m doing the right things I m high functioning I say all this to show that this is not a temporary problem Demographics are irrelevant This is not something I will outgrow It s a problem inherent within me regardless of what s happening to me No matter where I am or who I m with I have existed in isolation my entire life The anxiety and depression ensure this I ve seen councilors I ve seen psychologists I ve been hospitalized institutionalized on a few occasions I ve been monitored been in group therapy I ve had ECT I m taking prescriptions I m seeing a psychiatrist I practice mindfulness I remind myself to drink water I force myself to do a moderate amount of exercise every day I hate feeding myself but I graze on healthy food when I have to eat All these things prop me up enough so that I can hold down a job and rent an apartment I can keep myself alive but everything I consume is wasted I have been dragging myself through life for so many years and I m so incredibly tired My family just smiles and pretends I m making this up My two friends are so sick of hearing from me that I just don t bring it up anymore It s easier to keep a friend if I show interest in them once or twice a month without mentioning anything about myself Being attracted to someone makes me suicidal It always has Unfortunately I m not asexual so the situation arises every day at work online and whenever I go out I don t know what it s like to be close to someone I have tried but it has never been beneficial for either party The closer I get the more extreme the anxiety becomes It s overwhelming and unsustainable I break down I scare them The relationship ends before it begins I have tried I am trying After all the help I ve gotten I feel guilty for still feeling this way But right now I m wondering if what I m trying to suppress is only natural I m fighting against what my body is telling me to do I don t want to exist My life and my death are meaningless I don t know what I m asking for Sorry for bitching At least this is on the internet now,high,medium

Correctable mistakes snowballed into something horrible I end up paying for mistakes I ve made or risks I ve taken in my life ten times over I might also seriously have the worst luck ever I ve looked into ending my life but it says in the sidebar we re not allowed to discuss methods so I ll leave it at that It s almost like I m just a normal person trapped in a very very abnormal life By the time I realized what was going on way too much time had passed So I ve started to formulate my exit plan I hope no one will judge me here My father is something I can t even say on here because I m too embarrassed to even say it You can use your imagination though I was severely neglected by mother she didn t even teach me how to read make a bed drive a car ride a bike my dad provided the bare basics and I learned everything else by trial and error or other people s parents As a child she would throw my shoes out the window No one but my dad knew no one would even think to ask about something so bizarre right She was really unstable and would have very public screaming fits on vacations I ve literally never seen anyone act as crazy as her not even the mentally ill homeless people you might run into like she would be on a small rowboat screaming that she wants to die on a lake for thousands of people to hear She s apparently been in this conditon since she was in elementary school but no one got her any help My mother would try to get into car accidents while I was in her car and I don t really feel safe in cars unless I m the one driving anymore She would sneak up behind me while I showered or hide in closets pretend to mishear me when I spoke and instigate hours long screaming fights like clockwork every time I went out with friends While I lived with her she would leave raw meat out on the counter over night maybe in the hopes I might get sick My mother s thought process is actually even scarier than the behavior that I ve briefly described When I have a migraine she will withhold medication for hours If I cough once she ll keep asking me if I m okay If I have a fever she d tell me I m lazy When I m healthy she screams in my face daily that I turned out poorly because she spoiled me too much even though I was so conscious of money that I wore kid s jackets in college to save money lived in a bedroom apartment with roommates have never been on vacation with her since I was even though she goes on vacation twice a year I know it sounds trivial but she literally can t go a day without putting someone down about what college they went to It s actually crazy though it s not snobbery it s like some really weird scary obsession unlike anything I ve ever seen She only sees people through this one label it s like they are not even humans at all She never listened to music read or did much of anything It s compensatory narcissism taken to the next level The only emotions I ve ever seen her express are rage and sadness and a weird flatness She sees people as superheros or peasants For a while she became obsessed with the idea that I wasn t allowed to do more than survive So I had to convince her human beings are meant to do more than survive This barely scratches the surface of my experiences I honestly should not have been born My life is such a nightmare I m not even human in the normal sense of the word My dad is also mentally ill vindictive and violent They are way more than mentally ill and abusive though They re incredibly similar to the weird neighbors in the movie American Beauty but within the disorienting gritty world of American Horror Story Honestly when that series came out I wondered if Ryan Murphy had been stalking me all these years I was a victim of severe gaslighting sexual physical emotional and verbal abuse What makes it such a trap is that they are basically outcasts so everything is totally weird the way they talk they never joke my dad knows like a total of a words they just don t have the social skills even the average person might have even our house was weird the cars they drove were weird But since they were in such reactive denial about it I could never fully come to terms with the truth So I was so brainwashed my own eyes would deceive me You might wonder how in the world I could stay in a situation like that right I think I m pretty submissive by nature and my parents hammered it into me I wasn t allowed want the stable lifestyle my friends had my life has literally been a prison where I took it for granted that I belonged in a completely different world than everyone else and that led me down a really dark path for absolutely no reason I did try to go college at first I had a dissociative disorder my whole life and my mother constantly sabotaged my college education so I could never get away successfully She manipulated me into applying to lower tier schools than I initially qualified for I still trusted her at that point I was so used to being gaslighted that I couldn t even think they were abusive until I had suffered another years with PTSD while trying to have a normal college experience having to put up with weekly screaming matches where I d be told I would never get a job and be exploited whenever I needed any money I had to move in with my mother to save money and escape but she was aware of my intentions and embarked on this terrifying extinction burst She contacted her doctor and tried to get me medicated self diagnosed me with mental illnesses and tried to get her employees to ambush me catch me off guard in the most vulnerable time of my life thousands of miles away from my support network and emotionally abuse me and completely erase my past They told me I had always been a difficult child that I had grown up a loner with no friends and that I needed anger management I was incredibly disoriented and felt like my whole life was being stolen from me I thought I was literally dead for a full year So I had a total breakdown had to try to heal in the midst of this twisted malicious intervention engineered by my mother who is actually the one who has always needed help since she was a child and I ve finally come out of that only to realize that I ve been screwed I don t know what to do My life isn t worth living I wasted so much time I planned on spending healing in order to fight this ridiculous war I totally should have seen coming but I honestly never thought she would take it this far and I m completely worn out I realize now I shouldn t have let it get to me but at the time I wasn t aware of triggers CPTSD narcissism and the way abuse works I was really naive and thought that everything was going to work out that my mother would get help and I might have the family I always wanted I don t need anyone anymore but nothing makes me happy I have no future I should have spent a lifetime focusing on myself instead of my mother She would literally try to interrupt me from studying establishing a social life improving my appearance being liked by other people and somehow find a way to make me feel crushing guilt about this on a minute by minute day by day year by year basis I think there is nothing left in me that can possibly try anymore I ve been crushed too many times and this last disaster with her has really destabilized my life I m so behind and isolated I don t think the people I used to know would even recognize what my life has become,medium,medium

depressed anxious and overwhelmedHi so this is going to be extremely rambly because I m so anxious depressed I can barely string thoughts together Right now I am in an outpatient program I was inpatient before that and I m terrified I have horrible suicidal thoughts every time I go home but when I m at the program I m fine My new medication is upsetting my stomach even more than how my stomach usually is and I was told to tolerate it for a couple more weeks and see if it will stop They want me to go home for good in a couple weeks and that s even after I bargained for more time My mom is spending tons of money for me to stay in a motel and drive a couple hours back and forth on the off days from home to the program I m beyond anxious and I feel like there s no solution to my problems and I feel like such a burden to my mom and it s driving me crazy I feel like I have no future I m and I don t have a job I m not in school I don t know what I want to go to school for maybe I want to be a therapist maybe that s what I think I SHOULD do because I think my life has no worth if I don t help people I dunno I don t know if I could even handle school I suffer from severe undiagnosed fatigue issues and also some GI issues from taking antibiotics for a year and I could only manage to take one class a semester when I was going I think I should probably go to school away from my family to get out of my shitty area and house and to become more independent and reduce distraction but I have this fear that by leaving my parents I m going to regret leaving and losing that time with them when they die which is very overwhelming aaaaaand lastly I have only one friend who I met through the program but they live hours and hours away from me so I m struggling to accept that too because I already feel attached and I m trying to find reasons to stay in the area afterwards like going to school in the area just so I can be close friends with them and hang out all the time I m really trying not to kill myself right now but I m just drowning in pain and anxiety and fatigue and I can barely get out of bed No one can seem to help me and I just want to die to make it all stop,high,high
Tonight for the first time ever I m genuinely wondering if I want to keep goingI m I ve always been a pretty big time loner and since my middle school years have been very prone to bits of depression and despondence But tonight is the first time I ve ever genuinely wondered whether or not I wanted to keep going I ve been trying to sleep for three hours but there s just no way The thoughts are too strong I look at my own life I have a college degree that I can t use in a field I don t enjoy I m stuck bagging groceries and don t actually aspire to do anything more I have no one I d consider a friend My relationship with my family grows more and more distant as I begin to hate myself and withdraw myself more and more I don t see anything to look forward to I look at the world around me What a complete and total fucking mess Pandemic panic climate crises ever worsening political polarization rise in totalitarianism and Draconian policy worldwide I just don t see a single god damn thing to look forward to More and more I ve been projecting my self hatred onto others I view them as being like me Lowlife failures whose lives aren t worth anything I m not deserving of love assistance attention affection or acknowledgement and therefore neither are they And I hate myself a lot Hating everyone else that much is exhausting I could talk to a professional but that s a tough one for me When I was I was struggling in class because I hated myself back then to and wasn t trying so my mom dragged me to a psychiatrist On the spot he diagnosed me with ADD and gave me an Adderall prescription The third time I took it I was rushed to the hospital with a seizure that was caused by the medication This psych s solution was to see if my doctor could prescribe me a downer to go with the Adderall so that didn t happen again So since then my trust in the entire healthcare profession is utterly non existent I actively believe they try to harm their patients for profit Opening up to a therapist won t be easy or productive I don t think I d view it as walking into a room with a live grizzly bear I m just waiting for the harm to come my way So I hate myself a lot don t feel like there s anything going on in the future that s worth looking forward to and I feel just utterly broken I desperately need a break from social media that includes Reddit but unfortunately I hate myself too much to do what s right for me I m not sure I deserve help or that a person like me is worth talking down Maybe this ll pass Who knows But I ve never felt this before I should be in the prime of my life in my mid s But instead all I can bring myself to do is sit in my room alone on my laptop That s it That s what I aspire to I hate myself so much,medium,high

I want the sadness to endHello r SuicideWatch So I m a year old high school student who has been contemplating suicide lately For the past years I ve felt depressed almost all of the time I can t pinpoint any external factors in my life that might make me feel this way While I ve never been officially diagnosed with clinical depression or anything both of my parents have so I believe it s not too far fetched at all to say I may be genetically predisposed for it or something Some stretches of time have felt harder than others This past week is one of those times I ve had trouble getting to sleep I ve woken up late or early every day I ve had trouble focusing I don t feel engaged in anything I do I can t get myself to do any school work and I ve cried for at least half an hour every day The worst of it all has been the suicidal thoughts I ve unwillingly visualized myself killing myself in various ways The thoughts are simultaneously terrifying and liberating I don t think I have the nerve to act on them but I worry sometimes I ve been taking medication generic Lexapro every day and meeting with a counselor for an hour every week Both of these have a positive impact for sure but I don t know that they re enough I still feel hopeless sometimes like my life isn t worth living I feel miserable The worst part of it is that I feel like nobody would really notice if I did kill myself I feel like those who would notice wouldn t care all that much My mom gets mad at me when all I can do is mope around the house My dad rarely sees me and never seems to take my depression seriously One of my little brothers seems to despise me at worst and feel neutral towards me at best The other is a real sweet heart but said to me earlier today that nobody loves me That got to me All of my friends except for one have grown really distant from me over the past year The only friend I have who makes me feel wanted and loved by somebody has been out of the country for about months and won t return home for about more I don t know if I can last that long I miss her so much I honestly feel like I want to die right now I want the sadness to stop I can t handle it I feel worthless right now Sorry if it seems like I m just seeking attention but I m hoping getting this off my chest will help Any advice support comments etc are appreciated a lot,high,high

Consideration and thoughtHey Reddit I don t know how to really start this for my first post but hopefully you will bear with me and I hopefully at some point I ll be able to share my thoughts and feelings and people can empathize with me I m pretty much going to be throwing out my thoughts and I may sound strange at times so please forgive me if that happens I am suicidal It s not a continuous thing where I think about it non stop but I do get the thoughts often Some might look at me and think that I d have a pretty decent life and that there s nothing wrong with it I have friends who love me a family that cares about me sometimes and I guess I couldn t really pinpoint why I am suicidal I have been to the doctor for help after years of self diagnosis with depression I was not in the state of being too proud to ask for help but I was worried about being criticized by my family members I d often think about suicide and ways I could do it My main thought processes are Hanging myself I can t tie knots so this isn t really viable for me Drowning I have a morbid fear of water Jumping from a great height I also have a fear of heights I have never talked to anyone about this before apart from my doctor It took me a LOT of courage to visit the doctor Like I said earlier it took me about years to actually ask for help I think the main problem for me if you can call it a problem is that I d want to commit suicide but I can t find it in me to take my own life People might think it s a good thing that I m still here but for me it is an never ending battle with myself Whenever I have these thoughts I also think of how people would react to me successfully committing suicide I can imagine that they would feel bad obviously I think it s another reason why I can t do it I can give a lot to my friends and I am a rather selfless person I love my friends more than I love myself and I would do anything to make the ones I love happy I d walk on hot coals or broken glass or I d run into moving traffic just so my friend would smile They definitely wouldn t smile if I ran into traffic and died but this is my problem I suppose I don t want to be here but there are a few things in the way The doctor put me on a month waiting lost for a counselor and I ve been prescribed anti depressants My mother doesn t want me to take them because she believes that I will become dependant on them and she thinks I will turn out like a zombie I also asked one of my uncles and he described depression as a difficult thing He said it s all about training your mind to be positive For me that is very difficult and I didn t even think of bringing suicide up to him In honesty I don t think it s fair to tell anyone that I m suicidal I m only here writing this in the hope that I will find some relief Maybe I will I think the one true relief for me is suicide When I went for help my family members reacted negatively There was no praise in finding help which is understandable seeing as most of the time family members do not understand depression and suicide etc Friends might but in my eyes family doesn t My brother said I was lying to the doctor about how I feel which isn t true If I was crying and sighing non stop and I breathed deeply left the house and went to the doctor for what I thought was an emergency I needed the help While I wouldn t say I truly recieved help it was a weight that was lifted to find that my illness was recognised I was diagnosed with major depression anxiety and seasonal affective disorder at the start of this month I guess I really don t have a point to this because I m not really asking for help directly but it is a little better for me knowing I can speak to a wider audience about how I feel Suicidal thoughts for me are still ongoing everyday I am very very scared though as to if I ll go through with it Thank you for reading if you have I appreciate it,high,high

"Lately, I’ve been very depressed, and my BPD has been the worst it has in a while. I feel like 99% of the time I’m dissociating, or smoking weed, which doesn’t even help me anymore because I’ve developed such a high tolerance. I feel like I’ve been a jerk to my girlfriend, who is also my FP. I’ve been a jerk to my friends too. I barely speak anymore. I barely do anything. I just dissociate all day and stare blankly. But I also fly off the handle easily. The smallest thing will make me irrationally upset or angry, and it’s really hard for me to control it. I know I’ve been horrible and toxic, and the shame I feel for all my actions seems to weigh me even deeper. The more toxic I get, the more ashamed and filled with self hatred I become, and the more I hate myself, the more angry and emotionally erratic I get. I don’t know what to do. I’m on anti depressants, and I feel like they worked really well for me at first, but now they don’t work very well at all and I’m right where I was before I was hospitalized a few months ago. I feel so lost and helpless and I need help",high,high

"I have a friend who wears his diseases on his sleeve. He'll bring it up any chance he gets. However, all the diseases are easy to get diagnosed for: ADD, Depression, Anxiety, Bipolar (some other stuff I can't remember now). I think he even tried to diagnose himself with autism. At first, I just accepted it, but then he just won't shut up about them. Not just with me, but with complete strangers. It was like he viewed it as some sort of badge.
 
 Not to mention that he would always go through a cycle with his diseases: research, self diagnosis, confirmation from friends (by listing out the symptoms of his desired disease and saying he has them), then comfirmation by a doctor (by listing out the symptoms of his desired disease and saying he has them).
 
 You'd think having a mental disorder is a private matter. My mother had depression for my whole life and I never knew until I found the depression pills she hides.
 
 Anyways, this isn't about my friend really. I'm giving him the support he needs (even though it embarrasses me every time he brags about them). Instead, this is about factitious disorder and you. Do you have real mental diseases or factitious disorder? Read all about it below:

My friends betrayed me this happened years ago when I was One of my best friends threw a kickback at his pad It was his birthday Me and my three other close friends meet up about an hour before the party starts to help my friend setup We have beer liquor and we are all set A few people show up and we re just chillin having a few beers A couple shots of jack and time starts to fly Its now close to midnight and or so more people show up This is where it kicks off I can see some people are completely hammered and everyone serving up shots More people start to show up that we don t know and at this point im about beers and shots in My friend goes to the liquor store and come back with a few bottles of jameson This is where I blackout soon I keep pounding back more shots and I ve lost count Next thing you know it s am and everyones left except for our group of friends I m not feeling too good and go to sit down on the couch to try and rest As soon as i sit down i start to puke Luckily Someone next to me was puking earlier and they had a bucket and handed it to me The host gets upset and doesnt want anyone puking inside his house So im blacked out and I cant move so they try to carry me outside to the backyard I was too heavy so they drag my body on the floor and try to get me outside Now im faced down in the grass unable to move but still conscious One of my friends lifts my shirt up takes his belt off and starts to whip my back He s drunk and starts lashing at me nonstop for awhile The other guys then come outside to see what s going on They just stand around me laughing with him and don t stop him or say anything This went on for about an hour or so I am in so much pain I cant move my body or defend myself All I could do was yell and scream After awhile they see im not moving or saying anything and they think im dead So all four of them carry me into a car and throw me in a dumpster I remember being carried into a car and then waking up in a dumpster all bruised scarred and feeling like shit I can t believe my friends have done this to me These are people I loved stood up for and trusted I cut them off after that day and never spoke to them again I have never told anyone this I ve been keeping this inside and I occasionally get nightmares and flashbacks of that night I have developed trust issues with everyone after this and its really hard for me to make new friends I guess i ve been traumatized,medium,medium

 i was seeing a nurse prac for adhd, which i was diagnosed with in elementary school. max dose of adderall did nothing to help me so he told me i should get neuropsychologically tested

 i just found out about bpd from dr daniel fox on youtube (lmao) and went on a binge, and damn, so many things i KNOW i underplayed on this test were brought up in some of these vids. 
 
 paranoid ideation (ive had a handful of insane episode ive always had trouble explaining) absolute gut wrenching obsession with any romantic interest, lack of self, seething hatred that i keep inside and im in denial of, this numb void feeling in my chest, constant disassociation, this is all stuff i guess i always just accumulated to my personality or bc i was just a weird freak, that i always underplay. 
 
 do i bring this up? how do i tell her i wasnt completely truthful to myself or the test? this isnt a therapist i’ve seen a bunch, we sat for 3 sessions and did a bunch of pattern related tests, memory, attention, etc. and only got to talk about personality issues in the last 15 minutes of the last in person session.

"attend a business trip while starting new medication tldr i should be going on a business trip for 4 days with a colleague tomorrow and started new medication bupropione 2 days ago im really stressing out about the trip and dont know whether to got or not
 
 so i have very bad health anxiety since the february similar problems years ago but thats another story probably due to stress since im moving in another country for work next month stress gives me tension headaches and that leads to me thinking i have brain cancer and whatnot
 
 however since march im in a small startup until end of next month for the next funding round we got a business trip this week one of our ceos couldnt attend since shes busy otherwise therefore i am the only option left to go with our other ceo and also a friend of mine since 3 years the organizer specifcally required two people and one is not enough for whatever reason 
 
 i was really stressing out about this since small meeting directly put me into fight or flight lately last week i made a spontaneous visit at a psychiatrist who describwd me 150mg bupropione he told me side effects are not very relevant and i should start right away rather than wait for the business trip to be over the medication relieved my depression but anxiety is unchanged and i wake up at night with panic 
 
 like this i really just dont want to go on a business trip but canceling everything would mean that my colleague has to go alone 
 
 i cant decide what to do disappoint my colleagues and cringe because i have to tell them about my mental health issues or suffer really hard for a few days hoping i get no major panic attacks

NSFW Please help meI m and I stayed over my friends house but I stayed downstairs on the sofa because his room is quite small and the sofa would just be comfier I was struggling to sleep because I wasn t that tired and I usually go to bed much later than that in my own house His brother came downstairs I think he s or or something and I could hear him in the kitchen getting a drink or something but then I could hear he came into the dining room bit so he would have been able to see me and he just stayed in the area for a bit and went back into the kitchen He eventually came over to me and I thought he was just getting something from the living room so I just pretended to be asleep but then he said my name really quietly which I just ignored but he said it again so I was thinking what is he doing but still pretended to be asleep because I didn t know what else to do Then he put his hand on my chest and shook me a tiny bit and then went back into the kitchen for something He eventually came back in said my name again and then put his hand under the blanket and on my d ck which was getting hard at this point and idk why because I was nervous and shaking a little bit which I m surprised he didn t notice He was rubbing it a bit and eventually put his hand under my boxers but I turned over onto my side and he went back into the kitchen He was in there for a while doing something idk what he was doing and then he came back in and put his hand down my boxers again but this time my ass because my d ck was facing away from him I didn t know what to do anymore because I couldn t turn the other way again so I had to just let him and he started licking my ass and stuff and I just felt so awkward He went to put his finger up there but that was even worse than him touching my d ck so I just turned back around so I was laying on my back again He didn t even go back into the kitchen this time he just sat on the floor for a bit and then touched my d ck again wanking it and sucking it Then he moved my hand onto his and used my hand to wank his Eventually I came but I didn t enjoy it that much because it was so awkward He kept sucking me off after I had and wanked himself again with my hand until he came too and then he just licked everything up from my belly and went to sleep and I didn t sleep again all night I don t have any parents to tell because they died in a car crash a few years ago and so I just live with my grandad and I know he s someone that would go crazy and make it so awkward for me and I wouldn t be able to see my friend again and he s my closest friend in school My grandad is really ill too so I don t want him to have this as the last experience of his life but I need to tell someone and I didn t know where to post it so I found this page on Google I don t want to ruin my friends life but I haven t been able to sleep much since and can t concentrate on school work at all like I just stare into space mostly in classes and haven t seen my friends in a couple of weeks I ve just been pretending I m busy decorating my bedroom recently but I m just never in the mood to see them anymore I just think my life is ruined and I know it seems like something tiny but my head just doesn t feel like that and I ve been trying to force myself to snap out of it and act normally but it s when I have to focus on things I keep remembering that I m really sorry if this is weird or too much for this page thing I also collapsed in school or fainted or something which I don t know if something to do with this but I was just so tired so I asked to go to the toilet and collapsed in the hallway which a teacher seen and I just said I didn t get much sleep last night because I was playing games and they asked if I was sure and I said yes I m fine and just really warm because it was a warm day too Like idk if this is the right website for this but if you know somewhere else that s fine I m sorry,medium,medium

Lied my way out of the psych ward So a week ago I made a post asking if I should tell guidance about my failed suicide attempt Someone said I should and I decided to do it I ended up going to a psych ward as I thought I would and I just got out yesterday I was telling them that I felt better when in reality I still feel like killing myself I just didn t want to be in there anymore because the doctor didn t give a shit I told him that I wasn t feeling good when he asked how I was doing and he said If I went to the grocery store and asked how the clerk was doing I expect them to say good because that s the polite thing to do I don t want to hear their whole life story all I want to do is pay for my thing which made no fucking sense because it s not a grocery store it s a fucking psych ward I m supposed to be honest with how I am feeling After that he quickly wrapped the conversation up and the next day he would talk about his life He clearly didn t give a fuck I want to tell my therapist that I am thinking of trying suicide again but I am scared to go back and I don t know what to do Any help would be greatly appreciated,high,high

So why continue Ever since middle school I have wanted to commit suicide It s not gotten better I am in my final stretch of school at college I just want to end it My logic has shifted from I hate myself because I am an awful person who doesn t deserve to live to what s the point of living I figured it out I am just like everyone else We all have problems and we all have things we are good at and bad at That s fine There s no reason why I should hate myself But I do Every action I take causes me more sadness then happiness And the happiness I do attain never lasts more than a few days I ve tried medication and it makes everything worse Much worse What s the point of continuing on if the moments of happiness in life are drowned out by the sadness I feel of every day life I come into the world alone I go out alone I have a loving family amp caring friends I ve a bright future and I have almost a hundred grand to my name without so much as raising a finger to attain it I can t enjoy any of that Instead I focus on the fact that I can t enjoy it I focus on everything I do that s wrong regrettable past actions and why must I be hurtful towards anything I care about even if it s in jest I can be one of the nicest people and that s fine In fact I like making people happy because since I can t enjoy being happy at least I can window shop and watch your happiness What s the point of carrying on though It s as if everything I eat turns to ash The only reason I ve not killed myself just yet is because it s selfish and hurtful towards the people I care about I had a fairly disturbing thought process recently You always go out of your way for others Do something for yourself something you ve wanted since middle school Kill yourself I realize now that my preferred method for selfinflicted death is gunshot to the head Anything else would give me too much of a hesitation I have plenty to live for I don t want too I spend too much effort trying to accomplish my goals for things could make me happy I m tired of trying to be happy and failing constantly I can t make a moment of happiness last when I have an ocean of painful things to remember or harp on Even if it s not from that ocean I can look at other perspectives of my life and be disappointed in myself Ignoring the introspective causes of depression in my life another source is the complete meaningless of my life I work semi hard to attain certain goals and values and once completed the joy is rather limited but still existent However I am tired I am tired of work at the age of The rest of my life will be filled with nothing but work till I retire Wake up work sleep Repeat Why That s such a mind numbing task to endure for the rest of my for see able future It s definitely not something to look forward too I don t want to be alive if I am going to be forced to work for the rest of my life Fun fact I ve been commited to the hospital for self harm in fifth grade and have attempted suicide four times my last attempt being senior of highschool I used to cut myself I ve been put on antidepressants three times all with no real effect I was offered to moderate this place a while back I said no because this was gonna be hard to tell other people you should be alive when I didn t want to Of course the reason I gave MWM for my decline was that this place was far too depressing TL DR The emotions caused by the negatives of life outweigh the emotions by the positive So why carry on I want to stop putting effort into being alive It s far too much work and appears to have little to no pay off,high,high

Pushed to the edge and trying to find hopeI haven t made a post like this before but have reached out in the past with career guidance and the such Right now I m not doing well and I m in a really low place and am trying to find some outlet that won t scare and worry my friends and family I ve hit a breaking point and new rock bottom in the last years of depression and anxiety now knowing it as bipolar disorder with a recent diagnosis one month ago My post isn t a full as synopsis of everything and can never really be in a short post and may jump around My now ex girlfriend and I had dated exactly one year when she told me she emotionally cheated on me for three months with one of her coworkers and made out with him when they got drunk one night Now Some of my best friends got married this week where my ex was the maid of honor I had a conversation with my ex before the wedding letting her know I wanted to be friends still and to get anything that might set either of us off out of the way for our friends to have their day many advise no on the friends with the ex especially in this situation but I still care about her as a person and know she is a good person that has fucked up I miss my relationship more than I miss her as a romantic partner and just want my friendship that I have had with her to remain I don t have many friends left around me The night before their wedding I got a text from my sister saying my dad had gone to the hospital and didn t say much more than that My sisters and my parents are the only blood family I have that cares anything for me and my parents had stopped talking to me since my recent diagnosis of Bi Polar disorder They don t understand it and Don t believe I am and think I m chasing something that doesn t exists The next morning I tried to prop myself up for my friends wedding being happy for them and trying to forget my problems to be able to But I wasn t able to I feel so guilty and ashamed of myself but After drinking a little much I pushed my ex too far asking if she still wanted to be friends and if she was ok at the celebration after their wedding Beating the dead horse as we both promised not to do And told her I don t think being friends will ever work I knew I fucked up immediately and left the wedding and drove home I abandoned and ran away from all the family I had at their wedding My friends and fraternity brothers All this is too much for me right now with the added fact I ve changed myself for other people to please and keep them around like my ex and family I also followed my ex to an area and got a job that I don t find meaningful or fulfilling And the fact I lost all sense of accomplishment and fulfillment in activities I used to love I lead myself down a self destructive trail in the pursuit of what I thought would make me whole I know now that it s a problem I need to work on I ve sent an apology to my ex and my friends today to try to mend things a little I don t know how they feel but I can imagine it hurts is frustrating and an annoyance they didn t need I promised everyone around me I would never kill myself That it would magnify the pain I m feeling and put it on to them I m just so unstable right now even on medication therapy and exercise I know I can reach out to my friends for support and don t want to burden them I m just so afraid and lonely right now I don t want to die but death is looking more and more favorable I just want the unnecessary guilt and pain to go away To anyone that reads this thank you,high,medium

What to do next I m years old I just graduated high school in the spring I have struggled with depression on and off since But since spring of my life has been in a downward spiral August I moved out of my parents house two days before the start of my senior year of high school I spent all of that school year commuting hr plus to school all the while working full time to pay for somewhere I could live My grades suffered and when the time to apply to colleges came around I was left with one place that would take me and it was the school I least wanted to attend I sucked it up the rest of the school year and enrolled in summer courses at said college but I never attended a single class I just took advantage of the free counseling for students The psychologist there diagnosed me with borderline personality and major depressive disorder I came clean about the diagnosis to my parents and asked for their help I deferred my fall admission to the winter to take some time off and get right but just this morning my parents with two police officers at their sides kicked me out based on fear that I was going to be violent I have little money left because I spent it to enroll in summer classes no job no car and no place to go I tried to hang myself earlier today but I couldn t bring myself to fully commit,high,high

"Is it overcompensating because you feel unworthy, so you need to give others an added value, because you aren't one ?
 Is it you picking narcissistic people so that they feed of you, since it's familiar?
 Is it out of kindness and empathy?
 Is it out of guilt?
 Were you trying to save yourself through them?
 Why the self sacrifice?
 Why doing so and not being at all happy about it, even angry at yourself?
 Why those people disappear once you stuck on their side when they were in distress? Or was it you pushing them away, because you feel that now that you aren't needed you will be discarded? Or them changing their attitude? Are you the jerk at the end ? Or is it them ?
 And why does it feel good, so good when you weren't the one that messed it up, after asking most of the people you know, if you did? And why can't you get over it, ever, when you did?
 
 I've never had a ""sure"" answer for those questions, I don't trust my judgement, and maybe I'm just victimising myself, or maybe I'm not.
 
 Had been dealing with those interactions most of my life, I wanna break the cycle. 
 I try avoiding people that love bomb, friends that show up when things go wrong and disappear when life is nice again.

"i have not been suicidal for awhile, a good 3-4 months! I am still living with my parents, and my mom keeps all pills (&amp; other things i could use to hurt myself) in her room. she fills up a pill container for a few days, no more than 4 at a time. and will not let me take more atarax which i need throughout the day, so i have to ask her continuously. she also does not think i should take much, even though the safe amount is way more than i take everyday.basically, i do not get why I am trying if nothing is changing. i attempted my worst attempt about a year ago, I am about 5 months clean from self harm and am not suicidal! when does the trust come back? i understand she is scared, that is valid. but i will not grow at all if I am kept under lock &amp; key forever. why am i trying",medium,high
Apathetic towards life Basically I m going through an intense existential crisis Can t sleep because I m thinking constantly about the meaningless and futility of human existence and the fact that nothing that humans treasure in this world actually means anything to me and that I would be equally as fulfilled spending the rest of my life in a small room living on bowls of rice as I would living the mundane life of the average American forming superficial relationships with other and climbing the corporate ladder until I either save up enough money to retire and play bingo with other dying people buy a beachfront property like one of those snooty rich white people you see on HGTV or be like the average american and work until I meet my inevitable death Even if I become a doctor the lives I save are going to end anyway Even if I become a politician whatever country I try to save is going to crumble eventually anyway Even if I become a writer my words will be lost someday and one day every trace of humanity s existence will be wiped out and forgotten Literally the only thing I can think of that I would dream of doing would be to travel the world and see as much of it as I can but even the excitement of that is being stamped out by the constant overflowing of information on the internet about the world Why save a shit ton of money to travel to Japan when you could go online and look at pictures read travel blogs listen to their music on youtube do a bunch of other stuff that effectively would ruin the excitement of your life experience There are so many people better of than you that you can just live vicariously through and even if you don t frequent the internet very often you re still bound to at some point feel like you re experiencing some form of sensory overload with the media constantly in you face all the goddamn time Everything just feels like it s already been said and done and I m pretty honestly bored with life,medium,high

Do you guys notice how some commercials and shows increased their black cast presence Do you notice the increase of black people in commercials and television Just a disclaimer I am African American I m sharing an observation and this isn t an invitation for a racist discussion was a wild year when it came to racial injustice All of these protests and demands for change made me very happy and proud Obviously companies see these protests and come out in support and that s fine But some shows and commercials seems like pandering rather than a genuine desire to increase diversity I was watching a paper tower commercial and it was a black animated family I see a lot of new shows adding a number of black people to their cast I see Harvard pledging to admit more black students And many other commercials that you wouldn t usually see a black face on This is all great until you realize that a lot of these companies only do this amid a protest that pertains to race I ve never seen this rush for diversity when instances are normal normal meaning not a huge public outcry for racial reform Maybe I m reading too far into it but it s just what I noticed on television Companies putting a black face as the star of their commercial and calling it progress It s upsetting and these companies should have a genuine desire to push for diversity rather than pushing for it when it s convenient to show that you support an agenda,medium,low

"Abilify (Aripiprazole) has shown some clinical effectiveness in treating borderline personality disorder.
 
 And let me just say, these magic little tic tacs have made a world of difference for me, when combined with therapy and my antidepressant. A year ago, my romantic relationship was particularly triggering, and I was prone to episodes of rage and self harm. I felt horribly inadequate, alien and at a constant risk of being abandoned.
 
 Nowadays, my moods are steadier, without any sense of being ""zombified."" It feels like I have a chance to practice some self-soothing exercises when I'm feeling triggered, as opposed to suddenly flying into blinding, red-hot fury or a suicidal spiral of desperate sadness. My self perception is also a lot more rational- I still see my faults, but they don't seem world-ending, anymore. The people around me seem more accepting, trustworthy and empathetic. 
 
 Even if they're not prescribed Abilify, I highly recommend that anyone who is feeling ""stuck"" in their current treatment speaks to their psychiatrist about treatment options. I had to specifically ask about them, months after my diagnosis, to start the conversation.

Inevitable Turning in hrs I completely wasted my s by adapting the hermit lifestyle I stayed at home playing video games watching anime or wasting hours on end living in an MMO I think the major turning point was at or I found out that my fiance was cheating on me Not just in the normal way but picture this Imagine finding out that the wedding that your fiance is planning is not to you How did I find out On Myspace if you even remember that of all fucking places On top of that she and who I thought was my friend fucked behind my back Since then I ve turned to alcohol to numb the pain Over the last decade I ve had my share of ups and downs but the valleys have been long dark and never equaling the peaks When I was about I ended up in the hospital because of a date with Xanax and schnapps After that I was diagnosed with severe depression Fast forward to more a more present time Off antidepressants for years yr salary plus day per diem house truck getting out of debt and things are looking up right No not exactly Growing up in the lower class I ve learned that money isn t everything material possessions don t mean shit I m still alone and slowly realizing that all my chances are gone I mentioned earlier about the whore but that wasn t my only encounter with love I ve been involved with two others but one only used me for sex and the other just got away Just to make things fun lets throw in candidate number four Someone whom seemed like a perfect match Smart pretty shared the same hobbies Yeah you know the catch is coming She was engaged to my best friend On top of that they were living with me After a long and emotionally draining love triangle I accepted what was happening and they got married and eventually moved out I haven t talked to either of them in years Lets come a little closer to the present day about months ago the one who absolutely destroyed me texted me Stupidly I carried the conversation I mean I thought I was finally moving on The messages eventually stopped until two months ago I can t remember if I made contact or if she did I knew that this is a toxic situation and I should ve distanced myself from it but I just couldn t help myself About a month ago I came the closest I have ever been to actually taking my own life sending apology messages to my mom and sisters The last thing I want to do is cause my family grief Now to me sitting in a hotel writing this sorry sob story Conversations with my ex continue knowing there will never be a future between us Absolutely no self esteem to even look for anyone Let alone a tinder account that has gone nowhere The feeling to finally end it is getting stronger by the day I m at wits end here I travel of the year so the comfort of home is a rare escape that I almost never have and I think it would be so much easier for a stranger to be found dead in any given community that I am found in I just thought it would be nice for someone even just a random person on the internet to read just a small portion of this fucked up dream before it is forever silenced,medium,medium
