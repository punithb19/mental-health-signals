I recently went through a breakup and she said she still wants to be friends so I said I can try doing that but when she talks to me about things it always hurts. I just want to lose feelings so all this pain can stop it hurts so much and I cannot even cry about it. I do not want to hurt her because she said she does not want to never speak to me again but I do not know what to do here. When we were together she always hurt me so I do not know why I still love her. I wish we never met it would be much less painful How do I lose feelings?,medium,low

I just called a crysis hotline what a waste of time and tearsI don t want to make a new reddit account because I tried to last time I wanted to post and ended locked out of the site and it was just a nightmare so ya don t wreck my life and find out who i am I just called a crysis hotline and it was busy lol and I called more times and it was busy twice and then it rang and I hung up and then I called twice more and it was busy both times then I found another line for some local crysis centre i used to work as a telephone surveyer it was like someone trying to sell me a long distance plan over the phone just keep me on the line and keep trying to make the crysis center upsell special one time offer how about we send a mobile crysis unit and they come talk to you actually that sounds terrible I just wanted to talk to somebody about my problems because my doctor can t see me till feburary and I have no friends and my parents are a large part of the problem so basically I am alone I am completely and utterly alone and nobody really cares it s all up to you she says wow what a thing to say to someone with depression yes I know all my lifes decisions have been made by me i know that my life is either shitty or it isn t based off my actions I very much know that why would I be depressed if I didn t blame myself just fucking terrible now I m just drainned and sorta just pissed off instead of suicidal it s like the only support they will offer is putting you in a halfway house well I work fulltime so that s not gonna work and I don t have vacation days and I work nights so one of the things they do there is get you on a routine and give you support classes and whatever well that s not really gonna work if I get up at pm and go to bed at noon pm so basically the only support society has to offer is completely fucking up my life I actually don t mind my job I actually like it there it s the one safe spot in the world is work I live at home and I live my parents who raised very very fat I was obese by kindergarden and I have been since but I know it s not there fault because we are all only to blame ourselves for our problems then I tried to start losing the weight and I almost lost it all and then it s just they leave open bags of chips and cookies and chocolauts and just the most unhealthy high calorie garbage all over the house but why don t I just move out well because I tried to start a business with my credit and it didn t work out and now my current job barely pays off my loan payments and I ve maxed out my credit cards paying them rent which they feel they rightously deserve and are the greatest parents they know in their lives for not just telling me to get the fuck out I didn t even ask them to change their habits I just asked for them not to leave junk out where I can see it this was responded to in a way I only decribe by saying have you ever tried to take food away from an aggressive dog and they growl at you just completely almost out of charecter just an instintive aggressive violent response with no reason or consideration so now I m stuck and I really wanna kill myself just because I know they will get stuck with my debt I m not even hopelessly in debt I just can t leave here but I can t live being this fat anymore because nobody will love me or even even affectionitly touch me I don t even mean sex I just me anything not out of sympathy or pity from a female you know I don t even blame them for regecting me anymore they all actually out of their way nice to me so ya whatever I guess I m taking some art classes and I found out I m very talented lol I m a very honest person in a way that s great on camera But I m fat and people don t have sympathy for fat people well unless there in the process of asking forgiveness and making claims of future weight loss if you just try to put them in a normal life situation people inheritly react negatively because fat people are ugly I think it too but ya I can t fix it I know people won t accept this statement but when I m on my healthy diet I feel great and am not hungry because it s well balanced and not extremely low calorie But I come home from work and it s just there is food and sugar everywhere and as soon I get eating it I want more and then i don t care because I think I ve already fucked it up for myself I might as well just eat more so I don t feel bad and then i feel great for a little while and then I crash off the sugar and I feel terrible I feel god awful I feel doing nothing in the world that won t seem like unenjoyable effort and I just think about how bad I feel and how much I don t want to feel that way anymore and how much I wish i could just do something that would make me feel better so I get in my car and I drive to one of the oh so many mcdonalds and I get double cheeseburgers and each has calories that s calories I can eat in I dunno stop lights away from the mcdonalds and that like more than half of my total daily calorie needs on top of the regular diet which is about under my daily needs and the fucking near thousand calories of just junk food my parents leave around then all of a sudden I m like calories over my needs and then that s evey day and that s like all in the last hours of the day and the next day maybe I just don t care anymore and instead of coffee or diet coke in the morning for caffiene maybe I go and get two calorie energy drinks and the high is so good and the crash is so hard and I eat a couple more thousand calories of junk when I get home and feel terrible from crash it s just I meet people and I fall in love with them and I can see they care about me they go out of there way to be nice to me because they see how down I get on myself but if I ever try to just anything just any interaction beyond this totally not out of your way interaction I know we re in a art class and you say things to me that let me know you don t hate me because I act like I think you hate me but it s not because you hate me it s because I love yes I know I don t know what the word means but I like to use it you and you ll regect me and it s easier for me to perceive it as hate and you go out of your way to say it isn t and you care that little bit and I think why did she say that and you think maybe she likes me and it s just this natural reaction and attraction no desperation there isn t time to get desperate and you just say I m gonna play it cool and later maybe do something and then you get home and you remember I m almost pounds and she was just being nice and if I you even tried to talk to her directly outside of what the art deems nessisary she ll regect you like everyone else because you ve done that that same thing has happend dozens of times and you ve played it out like groundhogs day where you ve done every possible thing reacted everyway tried everything including not trying and it has all ended the same you know the worst part lately is I started going to the gym years ago and I m actually in pretty good shape I m just really really fat I lifting and flexibility and I cycle even though it s really hard being so fat and I got down to I m which the lightest I ve been in ever even as a kid I always had a higher body fat percentage the first time I ve been under bmi since I ve remember checking my weight and now in months I ve thrown away all of it and gained lbs and I remember how hard it was to lose and I remember I had all the advantages of starting something new and being excited about my new diet and just being able to ignore the junk food mostly it was always an issue always adding a few hundred calories here and there and now it s like you can sell everything you own get your debt to a controlable level and move out but I have to move walking distance from work because i bought a car when I was younger and I broke down and I lost my entire investment and my oh so generous and horribly unappreciated parents let me drive one there vechiles to work after they moved and took me with them it was a mistake to move out with them but I would have no car and I couldn t take my art classes or even have access to a gym because there isn t one around my work where I would have to move to and only be able to walk because there is no public transportation around there so ya I was looking for place in the river to jump in thin ice around some shores and I m not tryhing to violate the rules it s just it seemed like a good idea I was just gonna jump and swim to shore if I could make it and that seemed like a good idea then just go to the emergency room and cry and they would have to something I dunno it seemed lik e the only way to get any attention to my suffering without having to get in a confrontation with someone but whatever I m really tired now and I just want someone I dunno there is nothing I know nobody can help me the things I want that will make me happy I can t ask and don t have any right to ask but crying makes me tried and I don t like having to hear myself crying wouldn t be so bad if I didn t have to hear the whale it s like someone else it s like I m hearing some other person in the most heart breaking hopeless disappar and it frightens me I m just thinking wrong reacting wrong I just don t interpet the world correctly and everything that makes me meserable is all in my head and is all just a chosen personality flaw that I need to get over or go to therapy for and all of this will start over again tomorrow but it ll be friday so I can play video games on the weekend and maybe I ll get some mcdonalds and a big sugar slurpee and I ll be happy that s what I have to look forward to the only thing good in my life is the thing that makes so terrible,high,high

Guys this is important Cock and ball torture From Wikipedia the free encyclopedia at en wikipedia org https en wikipedia org Cock and ball torture CBT is a sexual activity involving application of pain or constriction to the male genitals This may involve directly painful activities such as genital piercing wax play genital spanking squeezing ball busting genital flogging urethral play tickle torture erotic electrostimulation or even kicking The recipient of such activities may receive direct physical pleasure via masochism or knowledge that the play is pleasing to a sadistic dominant Image Electrostimulation applied on a penis Contents Section In Pornography Section Ball stretcher Section Parachute Section Humbler Section Testicle cuff Section In pornography In addition to it s occasional role in BDSM pornography Tamakeri literally Ball kicking is a separate genre in Japan One notable actress in tamakeri is Erika Nagai who typically uses her martial arts skills to knee or kick men in the testicles Section Ball stretcher A ball stretcher is a sex toy that is fastened around a man in order to elongate the scrotum and provide a feeling of weight pulling the testicles away from the body While leather stretchers are most common other models are made of steel rings that are fastened with screws causing additional mildly uncomfortable weight to the wearer The length of the stretcher may vary from inches and the steel models can weigh as much as five pounds Section Parachute A Parachute is a small collar usually made from leather which fastens around the scrotum and from which weights can be hung Conical in shape three or four short chains hanging beneath to which weights can be attached Used as part of cock and ball torture within a BDSM relationship the parachute provides a constant drag and squeezing effects on the man s testicles Moderate weights of kg can be suspended especially during bondage Smaller weights can be used when the man is free to move when the swinging effect of the weight can restrict sudden movements as well as providing a visual stimulus for the dominant partner Section Humbler A humbler is a BDSM physical restraint device used to restrict the movement of a submissive male participant in a BDSM scene The humbler consists of a testicle cuff device which clamps around the base of the scrotum mounted in the center of a bar that passes behind the thighs at the base of the buttocks This forces the wearer to keep his legs forward as any attempt to to straighten the legs slightly pulls directly on the scrotum causing from considerable discomfort to extreme pain Section Testicle cuff A testicle cuff is a ring shaped device around the scrotum between the body and the testicles which when closed does not allow the testicles to slide through it A common type has two connected cuffs one around the scrotum and the other around the base of the penis They are just one of many devices to restrain the male genitalia A standard padlock may also be locked around the scrotum without the key it cannot be removed Some passive men enjoy the feeling of being owned while dominant individuals enjoy the sense of owning their partners Requiring such a man wear testicle cuffs symbolizes that his sexual organs belong to his partner who may be either male or female There is a level of humiliation involved by which they find sexual arousal The cuffs may even form part of a sexual fetish of the wearer or his partner However these are extreme uses of testicle cuffs More conventionally the device pulls down the testicles and keeps them there during stimulation which has a number of benefits Making the penis appear longer Pulling the testicles down and away from the base of the penis stretches the skin over the base of the penis and pubic bone exposing the additional inch or so of penile shaft that is normally hidden from view Improving sexual arousal While some men may be aroused by the feeling of being owned the physical feeling of stretching the ligaments that suspend the testicles has an effect similar to the more common practice of stretching one s legs and pointing the toes Preventing the testicles from lifting up so far that they become lodged under the skin immediately adjacent to the base of the penis a condition which can be very uncomfortable especially if the testicle is then squashed by the slap of skin during thrusting in sexual intercourse Delaying or intensifying ejaculation by preventing the testicles from rising normally to the point of no return It is much harder to reach an orgasm,medium,low

My Girlfriend Tried to Commit Suicide Today I m Not Supposed to Talk to Her Anymore I Need Help Long one guys but I m fucking shaking I have no one to talk to about this I started Dating Aly about a year ago Found her on tinder Turned out we went to the same middle school yada yada Aly has kids with the same father I am the father of a nearly year old We are both yrs old When we started dating she told me about her past Let s just say she hasn t had it easy Father committed suicide A failed marriage Etc I m also not in the best place right now My own custody battle is a story of its own and it s as bad as you can imagine Like that YT video of the lady fighting with the kids father about their haircut type of bad Since my son was born I decided to turn my life around Become more responsible get a degree yada yada I m actually proud to say that I ve already gotten an associate s degree bought a house been promoted It s not all been smooth But I m starting to see the changes I set out to make But I m way far from where I would like to be Not done by a long shot I literally see my son days out of the month and it fucking kills me It feels like torture Slow painful torture So anyways Aly s place was just down the street from mine So she would be over all the time and eventually her kids too So six months later she asked to move in I immediately raised some flags Reminded her about my situation with my kid going to school hour long weeks getting home at PM and working on the computer until AM I told her I had lived on my own since I left my parents and I literally didn t even know how to coexist with another human being She said she understood and it didn t matter She was also paying a month for rent and spending half the time at my place so from a financial perspective it did make sense So I reluctantly agreed Aly is amazing And I mean amazing She would like do everything around my house even though I would beg her not to She fucking loves my kid so much And it s genuine When he was diagnosed with autism she started researching got some type of autism therapy degree and just overall looks after him like if it was her own I ll go as far as to say that Aly is by far a better mom to my son that his actual give the kid an iPad and ignore him for the whole night evil spirited ass shitty excuse for a mother mother God I hate her So fast forward months and Aly has completely changed Lost extreme weight Taking prescription pills this palpable sadness always in her stare I know what s up immediately Because she told me She wanted more She wanted a baby with me She wanted me to say I love you back when she said it she wanted me to text her more take ker out more often Travel You know the little things And you know what She was right to want all those things She deserved them She had life throw every single bad scenario at her and she still turned out amazing Raised amazing kids Helped me with everything Hell yeah she deserved every single thing she asked for and much more I decided to be blunt it s hard for me to say no and I often commit to things that I know I don t want or can t do and I told her that at least for the time being Nothing about our relationship was going to be any different I am still committed to getting my life together and most importantly more time with my son I told I wasn t ready to have a baby I told her I probably wasn t going to travel and do all the things she wanted At least not very often Or actually not often at all But I told her she didn t have to settle around my plans and I understood if she didn t It would be selfish for me to ask her to just ride it out for a few years knowing full well she would do it if I asked I couldn t bear seeing her sad I couldn t bear knowing I was the cause of all that pain She shouldn t have to feel bad for wanting those things and put up with someone who wasn t as invested in the relationship as she was Man she didn t take it well She told me she didn t want to cause me any trouble or feel unwanted somewhere and that she would be out by the next day I told her she wasn t unwanted I was perfectly fine with the current situation I just knew that she wasn t I knew that she was sad And that I wasn t going to lie to her or lead her on The next day everything was fine As if nothing had happened Almost like if the conversation itself was all that she needed and she even seemed happy I dare say That same day I get this weird text from my kids mom Asking me to accompany her to an xray procedure for our son super weird that she would ask me to come along And to help her do her taxes I showed the text Aly and she said yeah she is just trying to spend the day with you Which I agreed was probably the case Nonetheless I told Aly I would go to the xray procedure because if anything else it would be a chance to see my son even if for a short period And that I definitely wouldn t be doing anyone s taxes As I m in the hospital something happened something finally snapped with Aly I get a frantic call from her friend that Aly had phoned her ex husband saying to take care of the kids and that she would be taking a bunch of pills Cops paramedics family Everyone rushed over to help her She had indeed taken a bunch of pills I heard about Xanax of whatever mg but idk if that s even possible some wine and slights cuts to her wrist She was rushed to the hospital and is now in stable condition Her family is not mad at me They told me that Aly sorta has a history of just straight up tragedy after tragedy turns out the guy she dated after her husband who she was madly in love with just randomly died of a heart attack and told me that the best thing I could do if I truly care about her is to block her number To not let her in my house To make sure I let her know I am absolutely not interested in even talking to her I understand the rational But man how can I just straight up ignore someone who has done so much for me I know it s not about my feelings I should think what s best for her I just don t think I can do it I m so fucking lost I need help,high,high

Falling apartI m and about to drop out of university I m simply far too depressed and anxious to cope with the work load I worked so hard to get into this uni in order to get away from my narcissistic father but now it seems that I will have to move back in with him I have no work experience or skills whatsoever The only thing I ve got going for me is the fact I got straight A grades in my A levels not sure what the US equivalent is I m in the UK but that doesn t mean anything to employers I took a year out before coming to university and did do some volunteering in a charity shop but I spent most of my time in the stock room so it wasn t very useful In this economy it seems that someone with no experience and mental health issues is not going to get far at all When I think of my future it seems incredibly bleak and disappointing I ve been on an SSRI since Thursday but it s just making me feel even worse and the side effects are awful I had therapy last Wednesday but I find it hard to talk about my problems Thankfully I have my mother and grandmother back home who are hugely supportive but I can t live with them for various reasons I have no friends back home though I hate my hometown It s not far from a major city but it s still small and incredibly boring Everyone from my old high school is moving on with their lives and I m at rock bottom I have no confidence to make new friends The only social contact I have is hook ups but it never progresses beyond sex Nobody in their right mind would date a loser like me anyway I would honestly rather die than face a lifetime of unemployment misemployment The only thing stopping me is the guilt of what it would do to my mum I m her only child and it would destroy her As I say though I really can t face my current situation I can t think of any other reason to go on,medium,medium

"So within the past couple months ive came to the realization that I have to deal with my borderline and bipolar. 
 
 Been out of the dating scene for two years after a string of awful relationships. Me and this girl have talked as friends everyday for 6 months been dating for 3, and it’s great overall I love her very much. 
 
 With the new relationship ive found myself creeping into old thought patterns and codependency. I’ve never been to a psychiatrist or anything, just been obsessed with personal development since I was 14. It’s hard to deal with because logically she has done nothing to trigger these emotions.
 
 I thought I had these aspects of myself dealt with and released but there’s still more. I find myself worrying about every little change in energy or if she will just get bored and leave me.

 I can’t afford going to therapy or anything but, I’m just wondering if anybody feels the same or has any advice. I really do love this woman and refuse to let bpd run me, it’s just so hard having the “flip” and spinning thoughts over nothing about someone you know cares about you.",low,medium

I wrote an abomination D Dr Blivious Brainwits was a man who liked tall women likely connected to his long standing slenderman fetish He sat alone at his booth staring across the club at his desired woman She too was sitting alone at another booth drinking a glass filled with some red liquid Blivious wondered what it was Perhaps I should ask her he thought It could serve as an excuse to introduce myself With that he gulped down the remainder of his beverage which was a strong mixture of whiskey and soy sauce It was an acquired taste but quite a good one for those capable of enjoying it He slid out of the booth and weaved his way clumsily through the crowd of club goers dancing to the emo trap bangers that the dj kept playing The track currently being played was pure fire a song called Helena Remix by My Chemical Romance and Metro Boomin featuring Savage The doctor soon found it difficult to tame his hips which had an incredible desire to begin swinging to the beat He pinched himself on the back of his left hand reminding himself of the task at hand the woman Nothing else mattered With newfound confidence he found himself able to resist dancing to the infectious club banger He walked over to the booth of the young woman and sat across from her May I ask madam what you are drinking He said smoothly speaking in a heavy British accent He flashed an awkward smile revealing his polished white teeth and unhealthy blood red gums The contrast was frightening He winked at her Take a sip she said as she pushed her glass towards Blivious He took it and had a short sip It tasted strongly of ketchup It was a local brew the Ketchbrau a ketchup infused beer The doctor raised one eyebrow and proceeded to gulp down the rest of the Ketchbrau in seconds Um sir The woman began That was my Yes yes Blivious waved his hand dismissively I shall buy you another madam he said with a strong Russian accent Tis will only take a moment m lady He stood up and went towards the bar As he walked he bulged his chest feeling prideful about the progress he had made with the woman All signs were looking good One Ketchbrau over here kind sir He cried at the bartender who nodded in response Actually he added Make it two Ketchbrau After receiving the drinks Blivious returned to the woman s booth He slid one drink towards her and she sipped it slowly as she eyed him suspiciously So she said I d appreciate it if you d introduce yourself She squinted at him Very well madam He said with a heavy French accent The woman frowned at the sudden accent change You are speaking to the widely acclaimed Dr Blivious Brainwits I have a Ph D He smiled Charmed yet madam He smiled even wider His gums appeared to stretch almost as if they may split in half It was frightening The woman frowned even harder making it appear as if she now had a unibrow So now that you know my credentials madam may I know yours He pulled a wooden pipe from his pocket and brought it to his lips He lit the pipe and began sucking down the fumes of the poison ivy he was smoking Not a single trace of smoke escaped from his lips He felt his lungs burning within his chest Seeing this the woman frowned further still her forehead becoming wrinkled and distorted from the effort Her forehead looked like that of an old woman I m uh call me Lindsey Lindsey Cocksworth She said still frowning Cocksworth Asked Blivious surprised Cocksworth sounds like a good sign he thought He smiled to himself Erm no I mean yes she blushed Blivious pulled his pipe from his mouth and put it to his nose inhaling the fumes It tickled the inside of his face Lindsey frowned even further her forehead contorting beyond what should have been humanly possible It was a horrible sight to behold Interesting surname madam May I ask of its origins He raised one eyebrow taking on a sensual and suggestive expression Well the woman suddenly stopped frowning and began smiling instead Want to find out doctor She winked Blivious suddenly felt something bulging in his underwear It was a sensation he hadn t felt in a long time Oh madam he gasped That is quite the suggestion I just may have to take you up on that offer He shifted in his booth leaning in closer to the woman Gladly Blivious sped down the street in his Lamborghini Corvette hybrid the Lamborvette It was a custom vehicle of his own design Lindsey sat in the passenger seat singing along to every emo trap banger that came on the radio She had been singing along to DaBaby s BOP Remix featuring Gerard Way and Travis Barker when they pulled into the doctor s driveway Blivious stepped out of his car and began walking towards the front door Lindsey close behind He slid the key in opening the door and turned to watch Lindsey as she walked towards him Despite the darkness of the night he thought he could see something protruding from between her legs Blivious blinked and rubbed his eyes thinking he was imagining things Lindsey walked into the house with the doctor who shut the door behind them The woman instantly pushed Blivious onto the couch asserting her dominance She let out a low inhuman growl Blivious was lying on his back looking up at the woman as she stripped her clothes off He smiled at her Until he saw her cock It was a massive juicy thick hunk of meat far beyond the length and girth of the average penis It was almost two feet long and several inches wide Blivious was about to stand up and run away but Lindey s growls intimated him and he dared not make a move As she growled he suddenly realized that her mouth was not moving He looked at her penis and realized the head of the penis had a mouth reminiscent of that of a dog Ma mad madam Blivious stuttered You you Silence She cried speaking from both her mouth and her penis at the same time The voice coming from her mouth was shrill and high while that of her cock was low and gritty They spoke in perfect unison I did not sign up for this madam He yelled using a heavy Nigerian accent GrrrrrrRAOW the penis said The woman looked down and began patting her penis as if it were a pet Shh she whispered to her cock Her cock grumbled in return Seeing her distracted the doctor made a run for it He rolled off the couch and quickly got to his feet sprinting to the door He had almost made it No No Madam you can t I can she said as she dragged him by his leg back towards the couch She let out a sinister cackle Nothing will stop me Blivious whimpered in despair as Lindsey tore his shirt off She began gripping and yanking on his pants struggling to pull them off as he squirmed desperately on the couch Her cock was now fully erect it s length almost five feet as it angled diagonally upwards Strangely enough however her balls were a normal size Lindsey had now ripped off Blivious s pants and underwear revealing his erect three inch dick She gripped her own penis and angled it down towards his The mouth of her penis licked it s lips preparing to give Blivious a penis to penis blowjob as tears streamed down his cheeks Her medium sized boobs began bouncing up and down by themselves as if they had a mind of their own Her nipples suddenly cracked and opened into two tiny mouths squealing excitedly Suddenly when he thought all hope had been lost Blivious had an idea He looked over towards his Amazon Echo device resting atop a table in the corner of the room Alexa He yelled Play an emo trap banger Lindsey s penis lips were only an inch away from his cock when his speakers began blasting music catching her off guard and startling her The song that began playing was WAP Remix by Cardi B and Jonathan Davis featuring Machine Gun Kelly Instantly Lindsey leapt back and away from Blivious She began uncontrollably bucking her hips front to back and side to side falling victim to the club banger Noooo She cried in protest as she began flailing and bouncing uncontrollably around the room in time with the music Ha You have been bested madam Said the doctor speaking in a thick Southern accent N not not possible Lindsey screamed Tis quite possible indeed madam He said as he stood up He put his clothes back on while the woman continued dancing uncontrollably Her penis was no longer erect and had gone back to being only three feet long and dangling He pulled his pipe from his pocket and began smoking The woman was now curled up in a ball in the corner of the room struggling to try and stop herself from dancing Blivious walked up to her and shoved his pipe up her penis mouth It howled in pain as it was lit on fire and began burning from the inside out By the time the song ended Lindsey was little more than a burnt up crusty corpse Blivious put his hands on his hips and smiled to himself Another job well done,medium,medium

Hello I don t want to be dramatic in this post it s not in my nature Instead I m going to talk out my plans why I feel this way and maybe have someone to talk to about it I m not looking to be diagnosed or be a patient to a therapist But just talk When I was years old my parents had their third child I was their first and I am their big brother They annoyed me and I annoyed them still do But they re my siblings and I love them A few months after my third sibling was born I started having these thoughts Terrible thoughts of ending my life at this very young age I had no friends I had no life I didn t do well in school and my parents always fought while I took care of my siblings I am now and my parents have long been divorced my dad literally proposed to his girlfriend just days ago She said yes and things are great for them and my siblings In fact I have three more little rugrats joining the family as my mom is currently pregnant with her boyfriend s third child I am still the oldest When I was years old i wanted to die But I didn t I stayed alive to protect my siblings However I said to myself that when I turn on that very day in September when my body turns years old I will end it all That is in years and I don t think I can do it I am not happy with my life I have a dead end job I didn t graduate high school I have friends which are more or less just people I hang out with and I have no concept of what my future contains But I don t want to die Yet I want to end my life on my birthday at PM on an age that is satisfactory for me Like or So far seems to be the winning number But the only thing that could possibly stop me from this is one thing A girl The brown eyed black haired girl I met in middle school She had a huge crush on me and when I asked her to dance at our graduation dance from middle school to high school she cried She even said at one point that she would marry me if we could I was too much in my own head to conceive this Hey a girl ACTUALLY likes me Cool I should date her was my thought process And while what we did throughout months of high school wasn t as much dating and more of acting like close friends I loved it But then I ruined my life by breaking up with her I just don t like her that way anymore I said When really the drama in my family with my parents divorce and my internal conflict of wanting to die was the answer I want to try again with the brown eyed girl as adults We still speak on a bi daily basis and it s to the point where she actually said I m her best friend I ve dreamed of proposing to her at Disney world after the fireworks have ended and watching her cry as she tried to mutter the words yes This is her perfect proposal A perfect proposal for a perfect wife to be But that is just a fairy tale The girl ignores me when I try to ask her for coffee or makes up some excuse as to why she can t go I want to understand and say well maybe she s telling the truth but in reality I know she flat out doesn t want to Well that s it I m resisting the urge to look over and reword the mess I spilled out over my keyboard but these are my naked thoughts I am most likely going to die in September of Anyone wanna chat,high,high

I m going to kill myself by the end of this monthI m a f I ve contemplating the idea of killing myself before whenever i was depressed on my pre teen years anyway i never did it cause deep inside me i knew it was my depression doing the thinking not my brain Now years later is the first time im actually thinking about it without being depressed I ve for the first time analyzed everything with a critical mind Life just makes no fucking sense The way the world works is the most stupid system that anyone could come up with im here now all down and fucking desperate because i can t get a job Im all suffocated by the senseless concept that money is I ve been trying to get a job since i finished school years ago but here none hires you if you have no experience you are ugly or they just don t fucking know you People here only hire friends of friends I can t push myself here cause Here s the thing I can t talk This has been my biggest problem my whole miserable life since i remember I don t know how to talk to people I can t express myself i can t even go to the grocery store alone to buy shit i ve had social anxiety in the past i ve been homeschooled the last years of high school All my problems are originated by my lacking social skills I ve always blamed this on my family for rising me like shit making me grow up to be the selfish incapable of talking piece of shit that i m now I always hated everyone for not liking me I only have one friend and she and my two siblings are the only people i talk to I mean don t even talk to them i just answer whatever shit they tell me BUT FINALLY i realized that i have none but myself to blame for this shitty life im living I fucking hate myself I can t believe I lived so long without realising it I fucking hate myself for isolate me and push everyone away from me I could have had so many friends but i pushed them away i never did anything nice for anyone I can t fucking think on one stupid small good thing i ever did for anyone I never hugged anyone honestly I ve never been to a party I ve never told anyone that i liked them I was never told neither I ve never kissed anyone There are so many things i never did cause i decided that the rest of the world wasn t worth it And now i see this things i always blamed on my upbringing and oh jesus im the only one to blame im so miserable i hate myself so much for it The worst part is that now i want to change that but i can t cause i was never given the tools to do so I was always alone I don t know how to reach out for anyone I honestly don t know what im supposed to do My sister was the only pilar in my life but yesterday she decided to stop helping me cause i never did anything with the help she gave me She is fucking right i hate seeing her waste her life trying to help a lost cause like me I live with my brother and he tries to talk to me but all i do is scream at him and tell him to leave me alone I have problems i d went to the therapist before i ve had like four different doctors over the past years but they never helped me cause i never told them anything they only asked me stuff and i answered them or i even let my mother answer the questions for me Now i have no money to go to a shrink I have no job my brother doens t have a job and i just can t do anything to get one I have no parents nor family besides my siblings My sister who was the only support i had decided to stop helping me and now Im here all alone in the dark in my room wondering how a piece of living shit like myself could get to the end of the month Im fucking desperate I have no tools to face what is comming I don t even want to die There are so many things i want to do but i cant because of how i am I don t want to die i just don t want to be myself anymore I fucking hate the person i ve become i can t un become me i don t know how i don t even think that that s possible i hate living in my skin I just wanted someone to know this How i am feeling To hear my feelings before i fade I won t send or tell this to any of the people i have left I know they can t help me The only person that can help me right now is me but im not able to i gave myself an ultimatum of days left to figure it out if i don t find a solution on this lapse i m going to kill myself p s ironically i ve always wanted to be a screenwriter but I desisted the idea because my writing sucks so i m sorry for whoever tried to understand what i just wrote here anyways thanks for listening,high,high
I ve spent the last yrs suffering why spend another As I lay here I try to sleep but to no avail Thoughts of what I did in my life to deserve such atrocities and be forced to live my life as I am I lost my entire family lost nearly all of my friends The few that stuck around are more fare weather benificial selfish assholes I ve tried to kill myself a few damn times and failed miserably Back in after losing my grandfather who was the only father figure I had in my life I decided I wanted to join him So I took pills not going to say which ones Because well yeah I m not an asshole but I ended up in the ER on deaths bed unfortunately we know how that ended up Tried to jump off the Golden Gate Bridge that ended with the biggest mind fucks of all time Then a few months ago I tried to hang myself I remember blacking out and going completely limp Woke up on the floor Suicide hotlines are a joke I m sure they help some people I text the crisis line sometimes wait an hour or and by the time the person gets on the phone I feel I m talking to a robot No emotion no ability to speak on how I really feel in fear of the police coming to snatch me up I suffer from severe depression bipolar PTSD anxiety stress I ve recently been diagnosed with PTSD so it s a learning curve but it s getting harder and harder for me to survive each day I will be soon I have absolutely zero If I died tomorrow I wouldn t have anybody to come claim my body and to bury me I would sit in the morgue for weeks until they stick me in a pauper grave as just a number My friends wouldn t care enough to do it let alone show up to a funeral if there was one I haven t heard anybody tell me they love me in almost years It s such a horrible feeling knowing you have been completely forgotten about in life Knowing nobody cares enough about you to tell you they love you As much as it hurts it helps me in my fight against myself in the never ending battle between life and death All I can do now is pray a helicopter airplane cement truck meteor or comet comes crashing through the roof and hitting me My luck I d probably survive as a head and partial torso and right shoulder Suicide and death are two things dear to me I wish I knew life and love But I guess that s life right You live and you learn whether you love or be loved is optional,high,high

The inertia s finally running outI ve spent the last or so years suppressing my desire to kill myself to finally die and not have to deal with any of this shit anymore and I don t even know why I don t know why I ve kept going until this point other than the fact that I m too poor to buy a gun I dream about it I fantasize about it It s the only remaining thing I have to look forward to my job is a dead end I m not going to college I have no real friends nothing to make me want to stick around I m beyond the point where this is just a quick escape from a bad situation my life has been shitty and pointless for years now and I m sick of coasting along just because I can t bring myself to do anything else I m unwilling to put the time and effort into spending years in college to maybe change something or to try and find a new shitty job that pays just as little that amounts to nothing more than a change of scenery or to find someone to talk to about this to try and hear them explain why my life is a precious thing I shouldn t waste or some shit like that I m just sick of this There is not a single aspect of my life that appeals to me in any way any longer and I m tired of staying in a world I don t want to be part of just because it s expected of me I just want to end this I ve dragged it out long enough already I don t stand to gain anything by continuing in this grain all that ll happen is I ll just postpone it even longer Hell I don t even know why I m bothering to post this because at the end of the day I m just gonna force myself to go to work in a few hours like nothing s wrong then come home to dream about finding a loaded gun again I don t want to be talked out of it I don t have any way to do it in the first place I guess I m just doing this because this is the kind of thing suicidal people are supposed to do I genuinely don t care if any of you are interested in trying to talk me out of this I just feel like saying shit that there s no way I could say under my real name,high,high
I m finally at a breaking pointI have no idea why I am writing this right now I m and I m a fucking loser I m a miserable person who sees all the negatives in any situation I ve fucked up every opportunity life has ever given me Everything to me seems stupid and pointless and I can t seem to find enjoyment out of anything that doesn t involve deep fantasy where I can forget who I am for brief periods of time My parents sent me to two different schools and I fucked up each of them for years and got no degree I have no real skills that can get me a job I ve been unemployed for two years straight almost I finally got a job four months ago and got so stressed out at a night time security guard job that I had to quit it was making me so incredibly miserable I m pathetic and I have no idea why I was feeling what I was feeling I can t put it into words I d just go to the job and start to feel panicked I ended up having to find an excuse to quit even though my parents asked me not to Now I m sitting here jobless wondering what do I do Even if I get a job is it going to stress me out to the point where I can t handle it Probably My father thinks I m a fucking loser and a disappointment even if he won t come right out and say it He s ashamed of me and that crushes me but there s nothing I can do Shame is something I ve come used to it scares me less than the stress I am going through I ve never had a girlfriend I ve never really kissed a girl I ve never had anyone love me back I ve never had someone I could put my arm around and say I love you too to me I live completely alone without another living soul around me I didn t used to drink until I started that job four months ago and now I do it just to feel normal Like just doing what everyone else does when their depressed makes me feel slightly better I ve been laying completely in the dark for hours crying because I have no hope for the future I m almost years old and there s nothing good out there coming I ve squandered every opportunity I ve been given and it s just too late I m a burden to everyone around me I tried to tell my parents how I felt around the holidays but they didn t get it They were worried for a few days and kept asking me over and over how I felt until I finally said better and then they figured I was past it all I wasn t They told me I need to talk to someone but I can t afford to go talk to a professional And even if I did where do I start How does a professional take my fucked up life and make me want to live it There s no digging myself out of this hole I m in I m stuck and I m going to stay stuck It s too late for me to start changing too late for me to get a girl too late for me to fix how I get when I go in public So fuck it right I m crying and screaming at the top of my lungs and I just don t know how to make it all stop I don t know why I m putting this in the suicide watch Reddit because I m too much of a coward to kill myself I want to do it but I m too afraid I ve tried before but I always chicken out I m useless even at that Again I just don t know why I m writing all this I m somewhat of a writer maybe I m hoping it ll make me feel better I was wrong Now I just feel embarassed ontop of it Jesus what do I do Do I keep limping along making people ashamed of me as I keep fucking everything up Wouldn t it be BETTER for me to just end it,high,high
I know I m in hellit seems very likely and I don t wanna continue feeling existentially cursed Every event seems to be directed at me and my downfall And I ve fallen And I keep falling Every thing I do seems to exacerbate the external circumstances I can t accomplish ANYTHING I say can t because I ve been optimistic and continued to fail years of my life Extreme psychological abuse Psychopathic mother Even after I ve escaped and dealt with the past reality is I still exist My existence seems inherently painful Full of anguish I suppose Surrounded by my own failures and inability to adapt Cursed is how I feel I continue to try results similar to the opposite so I m close to giving up I seem to be a beacon of stress my aura causing others to feel similarly Exhausted efforts to try and help me No results I have nobody left And I m not exaggerating Nobody seems to understand the inner turmoil of failing everything i try That misunderstanding leads to strain on relationships I m seen as lazy Not willing to try But nobody sees me how i feel trapped inside begging for mercy from my mind All I want is my brain to listen but since I can search for answers so well but I m failing terribly at studies my iq is too fucking high it s a choice I m BEGGING for mercy But I only descend farther I m ready to give up but what s the point I m trapped in this reality I tried offing myself a few years back when I was with my psychopath yes PSYCHOPATH narcissist mother over mg oxy A handful of clonazepam I ran into the woods Far as I could Yet I STILL WAKE UP IN A HOSPITAL BED this makes no fucking sense And it makes me feel trapped So I search for liberation,medium,high

Stop making suicide about you I m sorry to rant I really am I was just reading a post about a guy who had an acquaintance die by suicide and how he s feeling overwhelmed and anxious I know it s a terrible thing but what bothers me is that the comment section is all like ohh I am so sorry for you and I can t imagine what you are going through Are you fucking serious This is not about him a human being has died and he s thinking about his fucking self God damn this just reaffirms my wanting to die Like people don t care They only want to stop you from killing yourself and don t care about the pain you re in because they don t want to feel bad about your death This is it No one wants to feel bad about your death so just stay alive and suffer endlessly Gosh Poor dude that killed himself I really don t want to imagine the type of pain and suffering that went through his head If death brought him more peace than this life ever did then may he be in eternal peace So fucking selfish Everything,high,high

Suicidality came back after years of peaceHello I ve struggled with suicidal thoughts since I was years old I m now and self harm since I was as young as or so It comes back in different forms sometimes spontaneous attempts sometimes planned sometimes just an unbearable need to die But I wanted to ask a particular question if we re supposed to have a survival instinct as humans why on earth do I want to die all the time My therapist tells me to say I want to disappear instead of die or I want something to cease or I need a break etc But it s always quite precisely wanting to die I had a good years of barely any self harm or suicidal urges after being in CBT and I just moved countries and was recently diagnosed with PTSD after a huge breakdown and resurfacing suicidality I was just crossing the street and every bridge and rooftop was calling to me Then there was a bus coming my way I was on the sidewalk and I lost touch with reality I had no control over my body and I genuinely had no idea if I moved my body in front of the bus so it runs me over or if I was still standing on the sidewalk I opened my eyes and realized I was alive,high,high

i am a fake and i just want attentionI m a trans woman and i just graduated high school i have a couple self diagnosed mental health issues that have literally gotten in the way of me being able to get help and when i try and talk about it with anyone they brush me off and discredit what im talking about it is so strenuous to hold a conversation with someone and look functional i honestly dont think i could even make it through therapy and communicate that i have problems being alive and need help to manage them i had a therapist years ago the last time i was having trouble and since i was and dissociated every time i visited her office i was unable to sincerely discuss my issues i fucked it up and only brought up personal squabbles with my brother and how i felt like everyone was supposed to hate me i started seeing a new therapist last week since i was terrified i was gonna find my previous one who was actually really great was gonna be transphobic but they re apparently both friends and both tolerant so i feel like an ass about that but th epoint here is that i m extremely symptomatic and i dont think i can actually get through therapy that its not going to help me and i ll have wasted a lot of insurance money and time and energy i know for a fact that suicide would end my shitty pointless turmoil and that my therapist probably isnt going to believe me anyway because i dont know how to communicate how im feeling or literally even remember it by the time i ve been driven to her office and i cant drive because its sensory hell and i literally miss half the signs the last time i tried and i cant work because i can t drive but my parents expect me to drive and work and its hellish to try piling onto everything else im a fat hairy autogynephile and this world doesn t want me im a punchline im a waste and im gross,high,high

Losing hair and on the brinkHi SW I don t really know how to start this post I m and my hairline is receding it s not super bad yet but eventually it will be It s completely changing who I am and tonight I planned on ODing however I flushed the pills so I guess I m holding on for a bit longer I know considering killing yourself over hair is just plain retartar but to me it s so much more than that in the sense that I carry so much of my self identity in my looks The depressing part to me is going from someone who my friends relied on to be the positive one and the one who they could lean on and stuff I genuinely enjoy helping my friends through their hardships and giving direction then seeing them flourish The other aspect is going from someone who would get complimented on my looks or called an when I was younger to not I ve gained some weight as my emotional binging from hairloss got to me but I ve been going to the gym for the past months to fix that only kg to go woo I ve also been meditating daily to help myself alongside reading powerful self improvement books like habits of highly effective people how to Win friends and Influence people think and grow rich etc The really dumb part to me is I ve helped friends get past stuff like this and now I m letting it destroy me I really am I can t practice the advice I preach it seems I ve made so many efforts like those listed above to try just be a better person mentally and physically but idk nothing seems to work though I guess I m still here so something is working Now I know friends don t care about the hair on my head but women do but that s another story but I feel like I can t be their supportive and directive friend if I m not happy with myself My self esteem my confidence and my will to care is at an all time low It sucks I broke up with my girlfriend a month ago things were not good for either of us and now the worse my hair gets the worse I m getting I feel I m starting medication to try regrow my hair finasteride I m aware the risks but jesus I never thought something so little such as hair would make me very highly consider necking myself For other guys out there going through hairloss I hope you handle it much better than I I really believe it s not the biggest deal in the world it sucks yeah sure but it s not a deal breaker and other people don t care Hypocritical coming from me yup I realise I guess I m posting this also to try relieve some feelings I want to tell my best friend how I feel but he dismisses my hairloss as really something to not care about that I just can t adopt so I ve stopped talking to him about my feelings Hope you re all OK and persevere through your hardships Thanks for the support,medium,high

I know it doesn t mean much but here At this point I have no where else to turn too My friends don t want to hear it my family doesn t and so on With what little I have I honestly just need to vent before I die I m the standard age where no one knows what to do or where to go I want to be a writer I m just the fucking definition of a loser I learned a long time ago when I was I was diagnosed with not only depression by a very light form of autism Basicly I don t understand something s when it comes to learning it wasn t anything that couldn t be treated with therapy However the depression stuck I was bullied mercilessly at school and not one of the teachers or principles gave a damn about it They where more content to just watch It was embarressing to them that they had to go up to the government and tell them to fucking fix it Through out that part of my life I was a loner and never thought I would get friends I would just come home from school go play video games and imagine I was a hero a hero that no one understood but still wanted him around Then high school came My first year in grade proved to be the best part of my life I joined Anime Club I became a dnd player I made tons of new friends I helped set up a convention and so on But then grades and happened I met this one girl and at first I was shocked she asked me out first I took her to a movie and we kissed once I think then she didn t want to date me anymore and it was only a three week relationship so I didn t think much of it then her friend came into my English class and yelled stop raping my friend That s where it all went down hill The only place I was from that point was the anime club I was called a freak and a rapist At the same time a guy wanted to kill me constantly tried to set me on fire twice in the same day People relentlessly mocked me and I was the out cast again same deal in g At that point I reached fucked it and for my grad quote I said thank you Flying Spaghetti Monster The only people that liked that where the anime club members and my history teacher Everyone else got mad at me and said that was offensive and it didn t get better from their I left the high school and never turned back after I was done with tests and such Then the college College was to be a fresh start a new beginning but life has a way of fucking you up their as well As I said before I wanted to be a writer I wanted to write sci fi I took psychology English history and political environment But English and political weren t what I thought they where At first English was nice I met a girl their and we started dating for six months and the proffesor was really nice However things took a turn in the classes when it all became about how sucky men are and how awesome women are Both English and political environment kept saying that over and over and over again Men ruined this men ruined that white men destroyed everything that was good Hearing that day in and day out got on my nerves I know I wasn t bad I tried to be the better person in life but it never stuck I felt alone in those classes as no one wanted to hear um what about The writer of game of thrones He s white and awesome And so on but no all the stories we read white men are bad All the political talk was Tumblr and SJW bull shit disproven by multiple doctors and institutions And the tipping point was my gf at the time At first she was the women of my dreams She was beautiful to me shy nerdy a little creepy really liked creepy weird stuff and so on but then she met another girl and this girl twisted her as she was her only friend out side of me She would poke and prod my gf telling her I was bad and intentionally go out of her way to strain our relationship It got to the point my gf was starting to mentally abuse me andverbally abuse me I tried to fight for her I tried and nearly became I love her and I don t care what she does to me But my friends stopped me and forced me to look into the reality of the picture she was bad for me I gave it into our relationship but she gave nothing back I confronted her about it and everything I accused her of she accepted and never even once defended her self She accepted everything I said and had no remorse over it I then told her to go fuck her self and left breaking up with her And then even to add on to that her friend abanonded her after as she got what she wanted After that I then started focusing on finding a job but that came to no avail their was one girl I tried dating online but she just cheated on me and abandoned me I tried therapy only for it to fail me miserably six years of it and nothing came from it My family is sick and tired of seeing me sad I don t even talk to them about it anymore I just go and out a fake smile on to try and let them know I m fine when secretly I m not My friends abandoned me they go to me for their problems and when I try to go to them it s stunning radio silience I m alone and I have nobody the only reason I m posting here now is for someone to know that your loved Even if I don t know you please don t follow me Be better then the idiot who thought their was no other way I can t find my way out

Yesterday I was talked out of suicide by my ex boyfriend I don t really know what to say here I just feel like I need to get all this off of my chest For the past couple of years thoughts of self harm and suicide have come and gone even when I was in a really great place in life Recently the past few months things have gotten worse for me Multiple factors are piling up and it s starting to feel like it s entirely too much to handle This past weekend I stayed at my ex s house and tonight when I got home something just changed got worse somehow and I just wanted to end it I was actually going to do it For some reason though I spoke to him and he talked me out of it before he had to go to bed he has school today he wants me to get help but I can t afford to get any He told me that he might turn me in which I think means tell someone at his school or the police or something about what I ve been thinking of I told him I d never forgive him and I can t handle my parents reactions if he did tell someone but deep down I would give anything to have some help I ve told him for over a year now that I need help and I think he s just now starting to believe me He told me he will get me help no matter what but I m so afraid of some authority figure finding out what I ve been thinking of doing I can t even talk to anyone face to face about it I can barely talk to anybody about anything face to face I m not sure if I have social anxiety the talking to people being around people part depression both or neither but I m sure that I m sick of my life being this way I m sick of existing and not living I found this subreddit through MMFB which I found through IAMA and I just had to let it out somewhere where my face was unknown I don t know if you ve read this far but if you have thank you If you care for me to I can try to keep this updated Also in case someone was wondering why I don t go to another friend for help instead of my ex it s because my ex is literally the only friend I have I had a clique that we both hung out with but I stupidly pushed them away,high,high
effective suicide plan So I ve finally decided to take a turn to find peace To be honest my plan isn t well thought out and I m scared it s going to fail which means I ll have to face being found out and sent somewhere My current plan is to take enough melatonin and sedatives to knock myself out then go outside in the snow during the night wearing shorts and a t shirt and sleep there and hopefully the subzero cold kills me before I wake up in the morning Would this be effective,high,high

Really need someone to talk to I ve had social anxiety ever since I decided to go to a different school than all the people I grew up with during the transition from elementary school to high school During the early years in my life up to grade I wasn t socially anxious at all in fact I was always the one to make people laugh and put on a show didn t mind the spotlight The only problem was these people I never really felt like I fit in with the people I grew up with I d get invited out occasionally but I never really fit it so I decided to start over by going to a different high school This would be the worst decision of my life During my two years there I was paralyzed with anxiety made one friend and began to get depressed While everyone was out enjoying life and hanging out with friends I was glued to the computer getting lost in video games as an escape from reality I would play every second I had and I feel that s what lead me to develop an anxiety disorder Oddly enough I still had no problem going to and from class or walking alone in public or anything of that nature That was years ago I m now and have been through a lot since then After being diagnosed back in I was on various drugs most of them didn t work except for one cipralex For one whole year cipralex had effectively convinced me that my socially anxious days were over I could finally be that person I d always wanted to I always knew that I had that person in me but the anxiety was preventing me from being that person After a year of feeling on top of the world the medication started to lose it s effect and I slowly spiraled downward I was pretty bummed at this point I started reading up on social anxiety on the internet I wanted to know how it worked once I knew that I could surely put an end to it over time This is when I learned about cognitive behavioral therapy I originally got a book by David D Burns to overcome my anxiety but quit half way through I ended up living with the fact that I was anxious for a few years but back in December of I came across an audio series on overcoming social anxiety The series required you to listed to a tape each week and read over the handouts for that session every day And I was faithful I d read way past the recommended minutes a day often To be perfectly honest I now know more about SA than I have in my life and I m currently still on the program a little over half way through and being faithful I ve put many of the strategies and methods learned into every day life and have had some success I ve been able to calm myself down at times and focus more externally by rationalizing my irrational thinking and taking them into a situation that would normally make me anxious At this point you re probably thinking that I posted this in the wrong section and that it sounds like things are looking up Well they are and they aren t Getting over an anxiety disorder will cause relapses so I could have my anxiety under control for a few days and then a few days after feel like a wreck I m supposed to be looking at relapses as a positive thing because you can t have a relapse if you haven t made progress And I admit I have Here s the issue Although I have this whole whack of knowledge now and have seen in work first hand this requires a lot of work mentally See before I knew any of this I d just let the negative thinking flow freely but now anytime that occurs there are steps and things I need to do to escape for the vicious circle of anxiety On top of that there are things I m having trouble with now Getting out of the house can be a nightmare at times driving is nerve wracking at times Anytime I m stopped next to someone at a red light I tense up and freeze because I feel they are looking at me Even though I know that feelings can be false because they are created by thoughts and my thoughts are irrational Getting a job is another obstacle I ve yet to overcome I graduated from college months ago and have been unemployed since and to be honest as of late I ve been pretty much cooped up in my house with the occasional outing on weekends to a bar or lounge Every day when I wake up I know I have to prepare myself for another mental struggle with myself and it s tiring My friends don t usually contact me unless I initiate first And recently a friend who I ve known since I was has been really distant for some reason Bottom line is is it worth it I m no job can t even go to the store without having a battle with my own mind I just don t know what to do My family knows I have Anxiety but not specially Social Anxiety They don t understand that these simple things like going to the store or applying for a job are very challenging for me They chalk it up to me being lazy and unmotivated when in actuality if I had rid myself of this I would have be the polar opposite I want a future I don t want to be a deadbeat But at the same time there s only so long I can continue to get rid of my SA before I become tired I m starting to learn toward the it s not worth it side Can anyone give me some advice any advice If you read my entire post I really appreciate it TLDR Had a rough time in highschool no friends eventually diagnosed with social anxiety many years later tried medication that worked but eventually stopped Been doing cognitive therapy for the past months seems to be working but recently questioning whether or not it s even worth it anymore,medium,medium

How to I rebuild I asked my friend to describe the night he randomly came over to my place and found me trying to over dose I remembered very little from the night and wanted to try and piece together the parts nearly a year later so I can try and rebuild my self Here is what he sent me and I ve got to be honest it s just reminded me of how willing I was to pass and now I m just angry and upset that it didn t work It was all to do with Ex girlfriend who cheated me and left me in stupid amounts of debt I walked in and you was listening to Lil Peep but the version you d done Proper deep lyrics You was zoned out Completely vacant Non responsive but awake Covered in vomit Off your head Flat trashed throwing up blood You d given up You didn t want help I rang you an ambulance You refused to go with them You said you was scared of me because I was being passive aggressive cause I was demanding to know where your stash was And I was shouting You thought I was gonna kill you you was that far gone You lied to me about not having any and you d taken them all Until I went to roll a cig and found a bag of Xans in a pot And I snatched them and you begged me to give them back you got angry at me for refusing I couldn t help you I had to ring an ambulance At that point I genuinely thought you d have done anything to get those xans back and you had a blade next to you So I snatched your flat keys as well and took the bag and locked you inside whilst I rang an ambulance It was heavy shit bro You had completely given up Since that night I ve moved got clean become a manager of a campsite at the the side of the biggest lake in Italy and started earning more money than I ever thought possible for myself Yet I still can t look people in the eye or develop a genuine connection with another human being It makes me so sad because I know I have fight in me to achieve good things but at the same time every single thing I do just feels so pointless even when I m having complete fun Am I a lost cause or is there steps I can take on top of medication and therapy,medium,medium

"Howdy! I have not posted in this subreddit before so I hope my post meets the submission guidelines. 
 
 I am interested in the topic of mental illness and criminality. Today I read an article about an alleged terrorist who had been under surveillance by the FBI for an extended period. During this time, undercovers posed as love interests and terrorist sympathizers to coax a man who they identified as mentally ill into committing crimes. 
 
 Reference: http://www.mlive.com/news/detroit/index.ssf/2016/03/text_messages_reveal_undercove.html
 
 I do not defend the actions of people who willfully commit acts of violence, but it seems morally and ethically unsound to identify someone as mentally ill then coax them into criminal acts, especially involving terrorism.

It just seems like the right idea at the moment Hi reddit I ve lurked a while and things in my life have lately come to a fever pitch I feel trapped by everything and I don t feel like I live in a world where I m truly free anymore My relationships are burning me alive and even my friendships feel porous and deceitful I could use the kind words cause I know there are no answers I included my poetry I don t know why I guess to seem like an individual worth encouraging I can t escape the overriding feeling that everything in my life is rotting Thanks for your time I m a well traveled man with a stride and a plan to wander less near from so far But nothing I will see or ever have seen beats back the Big Bang in my yard See Williker Tidds who lived with his kids was a bootlegger hot off the south and when prohibition brought in inhibition Ol Williker whistled his mouth and said Jesus H Christ boy these people these people All looking for just a load off Now run back and forth and stay drunk on the sly While the cops they retreat from the law And though the money all goes up the expenses hose What if one could handle the weight Could one make such a still that its liquor would fill Every Sub Mason Dixon Line State Well Jehosephat Joe I know just where to go there s a rock that fell out of the sky And its shiny and hard and not an inch of its charred even though ten foot round the brush died And the sound it creates when you hit it or knock it is softer than you think it would And the air doesn t smell like there s burning in fact the scent surrounding s quite good But its steel like and feels like a distant vibration a rail for a train yet to come And its cold as a spring even though the damn thing is just cookin right there in the sun So he brought in a team and they all got the rock to sit stark on the back of his trailer And he hammered and blacksmithed and worked on great sheets of the asteroid thinner and paler And with tireless zeal and a few hurried meals Tidds fashioned a splendid machine And he stuffed it with grains and he churned up a batch that he knew would be sweet strong and clean But when the day came to cash in on his game Williker gasped cause he wasn t sure If inside of the still floating round in the mash was a light so bright and so pure that a glance would set ones imagination on fire and the soul too would in rapture burn For the colors contained in that shimmer or glimmer would take a gods mind just to learn And he swallowed and watched with a glow on his face and a helpless look right in his eyes He said Mercy what what is that and then went inside and turned off the light But at night he rest stubbornly and the thoughts in his head Ran around in insomniac roar And when he sat on the edge of the foot of his bed The light glowed outside of his door With a start he stood up and ran right to his still which emitted a casual hum and the light that shot out from the top of the tank lit the night like a placebo sun And his shout was so loud that was wife the old cow woke and waddled outside just to yell But the second she saw what dropped Willikers jaw then so too Etnas jaw promptly fell For the tank had been melting for quite a long time and the whiskey had boiled away And the brand new universe just sat there shining at the end of its very first day Theres a lot going on in universe spawn some things that you really can t know Like the sound planets make when theyre bumping and thumping as the galaxies they re inside grow And the trillion quarks making zillions of sparks as they bristle and crystal collide And the nebulas blooming and supernovas booming for young stars are too doomed to die And just hanging in air over two wide eyed stares the universe gained dimension and size And its growth was quite slow But quite steady and so in a year the Tidds moved lest they died For their house had been burned by a baby red giant like a superball coated with lava And their vase was erased by tiny black hole and some meteors got on the guavas And the living conditions grew dimmer and dimmer in the town where Williker lived And as land was devoured while men scattered and cowered People knew that something had to give For insurance adjusters had no clue what to write when the house was clearly just gone and replaced by universe golden and glowing and taking more insured houses on Then the government came with their titles and names and declared the small town a lost cause And in haste the whole state had to evacuate said the brand new ex states new state laws And for year after year the grand spectacle grew Until Tennessee was just an orb That hung twinkling high like a jewel in the sky Looking for a new state to absorb And slowly we retreat with the back of our feet hot from The Fires of Wondrous Creation But we all kinda wish that the need for the booze hadn t set up our own immolation For the commune we live in at the edge of the world while it numbers a billion strong Loses faith as the land that we have slips away and may be gone before way too long But there s hope in my heart for the world and its arts because the future is exceedingly bright For inside of the Big Bang the suns live so close that their day is no different from night And I m not really scared I m in love with my fate swallowed whole by the future constructive But maybe sometimes in the back of my mind i wish drinking was much less destructive,medium,medium

I want nothing more than for them to stay together and not spilt up, for the sake of the family.

I always thought as a kid that there was no way your parents could ever not like each other, but clearly I was far from right.

Just skip this Only posting because I spent like an hour writing it It s long but not crazy Just ranting Incapable of death My mum took everything away from me I understand why If I was in her position I d do it too I tried to strangle myself Obviously didn t work out It left a mark for a few hours and she saw Idk if she noticed or school told her after I d had a break down there It doesn t normally leave a mark but then again I didn t expect to be alive by the end of trying to die She asked me what I used and I told her She asked me what I expected would happen And I said I didn t know because I didn t want to explain What the fuck does she think I didn t do it for fun I did it because I wanted to end my life She keeps on saying what s the point in me hurting myself because I ll just end up with scarr s which will make me uncomfortable in myself when I m older I don t plan on getting older Is it just me that can t seem to control it sometimes That you just act without thinking about the consequences Its in the moment And it s to make yourself feel better in the moment because your in that much fucking pain She thinks she knows how I feel She said she had depression as a kid but she had nobody to go to I asked how she got better and she told me in time but sometimes she still feels depressed She keeps on saying stuff to suggest she s still depressed like I just don t have the energy Maybe she doesn t maybe she does have depression but she doesn t get my exact experience It s funny how she suddenly feels this way since I ve been diagnosed with it Idk weird coincidence or my fault Nobody ever fully will understand I don t understand Because she experienced this she thinks she knows everything about what s going on in my head right now She thinks I can just stop hurting myself That she should be able to just trust me Sometimes I m screaming for help but my mouth won t work and neither will my actions So I m stuck Or I find something to hurt myself with and my mum expects me to give it to her She doesn t get that I m rarely ever in a not suicidal state So the fuck am I going to give whatever I ve found to her if I want to die I hate being around her She could be so much worse But I hate it She thinks she can keep me safe but all she s doing is pushing me away I thought this would bring us closer Because sometimes we have a chat and it s good Every once in a blue moon But lately it s just been torture She s angry if I talk and angry if I don t Everything I do seems to be wrong And not to be big headed but I m a good kid I never answer back got good grades kind to everyone She thinks it was because of loosing friendships that I got severely depressed but I think it s partly because of her A big part I m going to end up running away weeks left of school until summer I plan on running away either from school or in the middle of the night Leaving Hopefully never coming back Finding a way to die because strangling myself and cutting my wrists don t seem to work There s a pier near where I live Maybe I ll jump from there Or a train line Maybe that d be the way And those are so unreliable and hard to get to from where I am but its going to get to that point I never thought it d get to the point where I m trying to hang myself with a scarf but it did All I want is to fucking die To end this torture Get away from my mum Never live another day Not good ones Not bad ones Forever I m tired Physically mentally I don t want to anymore Nor do I believe I can Its been a bad couple of days and it feels like nobody understands how bad its been Tried to end my life the last days Obviously failed And these are genuine attempts Where I ve said my thankyous written my note gotten upset as I tried to do it I probably won t try again for a little while Our of fear of my mum finding out Tbh I hope she looses confidence in keeping me safe It s the only way I ll actually become safer I don t want to be home I don t want to be anywhere I just want to die,high,high

TIERD Background I am F and I have had my autoimmune disease for almost years I live in pain every minute of everyday Each morning I take my medication and lay in bed and cry for an hour till it starts working I m constantly nauseous I have drs but they only manage things nothing gets better The disease affects my joints my stomach and anxiety I have had several surgeries including total knee replacements part of my colon removed hysterectomy just to name a few About a year ago when the opioid epidemic created by the CDC US government was implemented my pain dr of years said he could not prescribe the dose of pain medication I was on anymore With no choice I am now taking of the doses I had been prescribed for years Another side effect of the government being involved in my medications is my anxiety meds are very dangerous in combination with the pain meds My dr pcp for years who prescribed them said he isn t going to anymore no matter what It means NOTHING to any dr that I have no life anymore Their hands are tied Currently I can t deal with this anymore I m not going to get better in fact it took me years to get to a regimen of medication that somewhat worked I have no energy to try or care I looked into other drs and they seem worse than the ones I have now My husband of years wants to go together but we have a teenager who I don t want to leave without both parents My husband agreed to stay About a month ago I went outside by my favorite tree with my gun and tried to shoot myself The gun jammed My husband who was in the house ran outside and took my gun but yesterday while he was working I found his loaded gun and hid it His is better than mine Mine had never been shot before but his has My whole family knows how fucked up I feel My sister even agreed to take my kids if something happens to my husband and I I m very lost If my husband and I go together the kids will get a decent payout from life insurance If only I go then my husband gets it but mine isn t much since I don t work and I m disabled Why is it ok to make me live like this I throw up a bunch very nauseous get really bad headaches my stomach kills me my teeth are falling apart I can t sleep I worry about EVERYTHING I can t even open a water bottle without help because I don t have much strength anymore I can walk some although it s painful and I limp My arms amp legs don t bend or straighten normally my range of motion sucks The last x my husband and tried to get out I got really sick and threw up everywhere or I just hurt so bad I couldn t handle it My husband isn t a bad person and he is the only person who truly sees and feels me He works picks up groceries cleans the house makes dinner helps me get dressed paints my nails amp genuinely tries to make my life easier He always tells me he doesn t want me to go then I say so you want me to be miserable and feel like shit all the time Or I say You are very selfish you expect me to live so you aren t lonely Of course he says no to both questions but I only have choices Commit suicide or Stay and feel tortured Side note I started using medical marijuana even though it isn t legal in my state It helps but by no means could it be compared with my old pain medication Another fact is my pain dr does urine drug screens which not only check for illegal drugs but also shows what prescribed medications are in my system Caught with marijuana would not be good My husband doesn t use marijuana so he takes my medicine the day we go to the appointment and passes my drug test but it shouldn t be like this Everyone says there is always light at the end of the tunnel but I can t even find the tunnel I wish I could take all my medicine and overdose but I m scared it won t work I think the gun is the best option I have notes written and my husband and I have planned my funeral I m so fucking overwhelmed Summary I m sick in pain amp I am ready to die,high,high

Last NightLast night I spent some of the last of my money at the bar getting blackout drunk I talked about football with this random guy I talked about first downs and special teams while I was choking back tears I got to that sweet part of the night where I went cross eyed I was seeing double of everything and I had a pounding headache I decide to engage in this self sabotaging behavior because I want to make it easier to finally end my life I get drunk and kill off the microscopic bit of hope I have so I have nothing to cling to when considering suicide I sat at the bar almost falling off the stool and it really hit me this time I really could kill myself tonight I always wondered what it would feel like to finally go over the edge what would your own brain sound like in the moment where you became ok with dying Was it peaceful was it scary was it just somewhere in between What it is is the feeling that beyond a shadow of a doubt you would not feel the consequences of suicide because you will be dead All of my friends My family If I had the choice I would end my life without hurting them but in reality I won t exist it won t effect me it will be nothing I silently decided ok I think tonight is the night I stood up turned to the guy I was talking to smiled and told him to have a great night He gave me a drunken pat on the back and said ok you too and I left My first thought was are you ok with that guy being the last human being you talk to And immediately I thought yes Who cares It s all symbolic horse shit that won t mean anything after I m dead It s the same nonsense that makes people want to have their ashes scattered at the beach and that s never been me so why should I care I left the bar and just started walking I didn t know where I was going but I really hoped the courage to end it was at my destination I walked through downtown Tucson for a bit I started looking at all these beautiful college kids at the clubs and bars all with a major a plan a path I ve never really envied them or at least I never thought walking their path would make me happier but my whole life was spent trying to rationalize how me and all of them could have such wildly different journeys on this planet for better or for worse Last night though I couldn t help but find the humor in it Everyone of them that saw me walk passed probably assumed I was someone that I went to school somewhere that I had an identity outside of being nobody It made me think about how there s probably plenty of people I see actively contemplating their death that just blend in like me It made me think even if it were just for a second to reconsider what I aimed to do that night I thought about it for a second I thought about just going home and sleeping it off and keeping on keeping on in the morning Then I remembered I already made my choice I didn t sabotage my chances at the future so I could back out now I intended to do what I ve known needed to be done since I was I kept walking and walking and walking I walked past a gas station with a cigarette ad in the window I thought about what a shame it was that I quit smoking for my health I thought about how now in retrospect I should of eaten Mcdonalds and chocolate cake everyday I should of done Heroin and every other drug under the sun I thought about how tame my life was because there was a tomorrow to live for At this I was out of downtown and well into the outskirts of Tucson It was about AM at this point I finally reached a highway It wasn t like an interstate more like a lane avenue that has a sidewalk running alongside it I d see these wheelers come buy at MPH Upon seeing this I could feel almost muscle spasms in my knees that were willing me to jump in front of one of these things I thought about it for a second What if I jump and they swerved and caused an accident What if it killed other people but not me I couldn t bring myself to do it for that reason I continued walking down the highway Even though I wasn t gonna jump in front of one of these cars everyone that passed filled my head with visuals of me splattered all of the road I walked until I saw a park I don t know what possessed me but I just entered the park with no intention I spotted a bench and threw myself in to it I leaned over the side and vomited then I passed out I woke up hours later with an awful headache Something about the way I felt just told me I had missed my chance to end my life I knew that the state I was in before I passed out was my opportunity to finally have the balls to do it and I let it slip away I don t know when I ll ever be able to capture it again Today I woke back up in purgatory where I ll remain Life is endless suffering,high,high
I just need someone to listen to me Back story I m I ve been suffering from depression for or years but I don t want to go back to the doctor because I m scared that they won t take me seriously and think I m just another teenager I have never talked about my problems to anyone else because when I try I freeze and am unable to say anything Over the past couple of years I have tried to kill myself over times including pills and alcohol and trying to drown myself Now to my current problems I came out at gay when I finished my GCSE s at All my friends said they didn t care and all but within months I only had or friends that would still talk to me When I went back to the school to pick up my GCSE certificates about people all my old friends and classmates included started shouting insults like faggot and queer right up until I was minutes down the road and couldn t hear them any more My best friend at the time stopped talking to me about or months after this incident My other friend at that time still talked to me and did right up until October when he stopped talking to me and started doing drugs and all sorts When I went to a new school after a year to start my A Levels I made new friends and they would come out with me and smoke weed and such but then a month ago they did the exact same thing as my other good friends did and just stopped talking to me unless they need me for something usually to ask me for a cigarette At this same time a month or so my last friends had a baby Now I understand that they had a baby and all but they just stopped talking to me as well It s not even that they ve not had time due to their child but they have been going out nearly every day and had time to themselves but nothing Now I have no friends that will talk to me and the only person I ve talked to today is my mom and that was about words I m in love with a straight guy in my school I would talk to him and say how I feel but I m scared about what will happen due to my year group in school consisting of a whole people who are all very good friends with each other plus the way they get on with each other consists of finding something to make fun f someone for and taking the piss out of that for a long time If I did say anything my whole year group in school would hear about it within a day and I won t be able to stay there for another year because people will go on about it every day I can t go to another school as this was the only one I was able to go to since I was previously doing a electrician training course somewhere else I m also poor as fuck My mom has a lot of health problems and is unable to work My dad works a job that earns just enough to cover the bills I ve been trying to find a job but somehow the people with no qualifications at all get picked for jobs instead of me All my clothes are borderline too small and are at least a year old I m sorry about this rant and I thank you for reading it It took me hours and cigarettes to finally get written out,high,high

If you were would you want to live If you were me Ok I m I used to study medicine but that didn t work out Then I got a job in the city which I loved and a few months later everything changed I was Basically I started hearing a voice never did drugs or anything and I had this voice control me ever since I know it sounds like a bad movie but this voice can control everything I do and say It made me lose my job It stopped me going to the gym and being healthy It makes me smoke every day It doesn t let me get another job or talk to a girl or exercise My life is watching tv twitter reddit all night until am in the morning Then waking up at pm and going out to get a coffee alone Then watching t v again until am the next day Medication has been tried and doesn t help I saw a psychologist but I guess it was too much for her because she said she wasn t experienced enough lol So imagine right now you can no longer work be in love you have to smoke which you don t want to and you can t exercise Your life is tv It s like a prison Would you want to live like that It s not enough for me I have a loving family and a couple of friends but it s just not enough I want a job and my own place and love but I will never have it because this voice won t let me Btw thankfully this voice has never made me do anything illegal or dangerous,medium,high

Thoughts I m a male I m and I ve done drugs in the past hours Now I sit back down at my computer at my parents house and start on my second beer I was a hopeful lad great at baseball and a seeming knack for just getting it I counted the girls that liked me on my fingers while taking a poop That was like rd grade I had orthodontics for years and even though I didn t decide for myself that I wanted to do the treatment or perform the treatment I feel the blame for the negative results and think the whole thing genuinely fucked up my life I feel the blame for the process because to some degree or another I do feel that we are responsible for our cards Call it Karma I still want to blame others I should have had better follow up and guidance during the orthodontic process After all I started when I was What went wrong was that I was a boy I didn t like to take showers and I didn t like to wear fucking headgear or retainers at night so I didn t and being young what could go wrong Mistake My transition to my freshman year of college was greeted by a lovely surprise Because of my orthodontics and sparse retainer use the way my teeth came together shifted and started wreaking havoc with how I hold my jaw My jaw started jutting forward producing an underbite which was new to me Picture this Here I am freshman year of college supposedly the most socially engaging and fun years of my life and I have a lower jaw that s growing like Pinocchio I totally freaked and even though I made attempts at being social it never came naturally and increasing jaw tension and attention on the jaw only made matters worse At this point I started becoming increasingly reclusive All social situations were an uphill battle and subconsciously I couldn t wait to get out of them I know as a culture we re socially stunted my big thing is that I m special because I really had it bad with this I started to recognize that every conversation I started to have turned into me introspectively judging how my jaw looks to that person This feedback loop of increasing attention to that region and genuine orthodontic fuck up only increased my jaw tension I turned to Buddhism and meditation After finishing college I started living at Buddhist monasteries There wasn t much responsibility and there wasn t much social interaction but enough to suffice to the idea of being part of something and moving forward I did this for a few years and became quite a skilled meditator because I was disciplined and motivated enough to only escape to meditation not to videogames and other stuff porn Because I grew up in an upper middle class family the blueprint of being successful is as good as hardwired into me I needed to prove to my family and friends that I could make it and I needed to be good at meditation because it was is the only thing I have faith that has genuinely produced earnest positivity in human beings Well this push pull of western and eastern ideology in your mid twenties is probably going to be a shit show and I haven t proved any different I went as far as becoming a monk for a year and have lived in monasteries for years out of the since I have graduated The other time I spent hiking the Appalachian Trail and moving to DC failing pretty badly at getting off the ground in job or social aspects Now I m and feel like I m being spoon fed a hot coal of bitter medicine Jaw problems aren t just jaw problems Our teeth and bite have a whole shit load to do with how the neck and spine co operate with eachother When things are out of whack with your bite it can throw the entire spinal chain off in ways we don t really understand yet The body is an unbelievably complex and connected machine This has only increased my jaw tension and I had an X ray done for confirmed scoliosis in my back I m and the bitter medicine is that barring a miracle I m not turning this physical decline around That s the gut punch Ever since I ve always thought that I d get through this and be able to communicate and socialize and get pretty girls and do all the things that I was promised That s never going to happen and in all likelihood my body is only going to turn more and more into a prison I don t have any trade skills I don t socialize It just seems bleak when I put it down and lay the facts out I ve been home at my parents for over a month now and my habits are vaporizing I m lost I m paranoid I m unwilling to try new things I can t go forward I can t go backwards and I can t stand still amp x B amp x B,medium,high

After trying so hard she s ready to give up everythingEdit I m sorry this ended up being a wall of text out of my own anger I m really not sure where to start with this I m going to explain what I know as well as what I think is occurring My cousin has had a rough year She can t find a job due to job market being crappy she doesn t know what she wants to do for a career she is out of school because of financial trouble and she was diagnosed with a type of cancer that may prevent her from having kids She isn t married but I know she has always wanted to be a good wife and mother someday All of those problems are awful but there is something else that upsets her more Last night I was forced to go to a family event and I spoke with her to kill time I learned that she was still with a guy that she had problems with late last year I don t know what kind of problems I only know that they both messed up and were trying to be adults about it and repair their relationship I thought that was really nice that instead of breaking up they were being reasonable and realistic in order to stay together But I think something else must have happened recently something bad During the time that the two have dated I noticed all of her accounts on different websites disappearing completely Her Facebook disappeared first That one was always pretty inactive so I didn t say anything about it when I first noticed it was gone But she used to post drawings weekly on a few sites and kept a blog for writing and one for photography She also used to frequent Reddit All of those accounts are gone now I thought why she would trash her art and stories like that I felt like I was going to explode if I didn t ask her about it so I hinted at it in conversation She told me My boyfriend thought I relied on the sites for attention I want him to see that I don t She said that with a happy face I couldn t believe that was the reason She drew things she liked for herself she didn t draw things other people liked to gain attention I asked her about the other sites and got similar answers I don t know what has happened between the two I don t know if my cousin ever was an attention whore If she was she certainly isn t now She is nonexistent cautious humiliated and very down on herself I stopped asking her about it and we sat down When she was reaching for a napkin she accidentally tipped over a glass that has a small amount of water inside She stood up to clean it and apologized dozens of times I heard her mumble to herself You idiot You retard She has never had good self esteem but this is a new low I later asked her if her boyfriend has ever called her names She said yes but it was because she always did something to deserve it I can t imagine what All I know is that I would never call someone I loved a retard And if that word ever came out I would apologize immediately I don t know how this man talks to his family and friends but I don t think it s the same way that he talks to my cousin I noticed she has harmed herself physically She has also lost weight Whatever he has said to her it s been bad enough to make her physically ill and stressed enough to harm herself to escape it I used to harm myself and I know how much mental pain you have to be in to do it I can t believe someone put her through that and wasn t worried enough to change how they communicate I had to go to go back to the house the gathering was at to pick up my coat Since her home is in the area I stopped by to ask her if I could see some of her art I figured that might cheer her up I just realized that I forgot to mention her and her boyfriend are in a long distance relationship That is relevant because while at the gathering last night she was asking about jobs from relatives that live in the same state as the guy She had no luck When I got to her house she had about fifty tabs pulled up online for jobs in his area I noticed her room was very bare She used to have posters on the walls stuffed animals on her bed you know it looked like a room someone lived in and liked Now almost every single thing she owns is in boxes and a lot of her personal items seemed to be gone She told me not to worry that it had been packed up for weeks That makes me think that she s been just as stressed for weeks and that s worse As I have said I have no idea what they re relationship is like entirely I know they ve had really bad fights and it s put her in a very dark state of mind But I also know he s flown her out to his parents home and taken care of her during her stay with no problems at all I feel like she will do something drastic if she doesn t get to move If she moves or doesn t she has a lot of healing to do Her self esteem is very damaged I asked her why she was so stressed about finding work she responded He doesn t think I have tried He doesn t think I care for him I do everything wrong I have to do something right I disagree with that If I didn t I wouldn t be posting here I know her boyfriend shows he cares by taking her out to eat and buying her gifts She isn t doing well financially and neither are her parents so she shows her feelings by making amazing art pieces and sewing stuffed animals and key chain characters based off of good memories about their relationship I know he s thrown the gifts in the trash with her in the room I m guessing he s also made her feel bad about the times he s spent money He calls her names and has convinced her she s retarded I can t tell if he has a bad way of showing he cares or if he is the one that has mental problems The breaking point for her seems to be when he says that she doesn t care If she didn t care why would she spend hours on art and sewing Why would all her possessions be in boxes Why would she be applying to every job she can find from a fast food cashier to a janitor I am so confused that she does all of those things and that he flies her out to see him and then says that she doesn t care about him The last thing she said to me was What if he doesn t love me after all of this I won t know what to live for Their relationship none of my business I am just very angry that my smart and talented cousin has been cut down by a man that she wants to be with I think we have all had our feelings hurt by someone we care about But I have never been in a serious relationship so I don t know what to say to her There are two sides to every story but I really don t care what his is I don t think whatever he says could make it okay that my cousin has hurt herself and given up almost all of her hobbies that make her who she is I certainly don t think his story would make me feel that my cousin should die I don t know how to help her She probably doesn t want to talk about the bad parts of the relationship there isn t much I can do to help her find work and worst of all I wouldn t know where to start when helping her build self confidence back up I might ask her to post here if she feels like talking Please don t assume that my cousin has mental issues because of this She is a very caring person probably too caring sometimes I just don t want her to end her life or think that there is no good reason for her to live just because someone she loves thinks it s normal to verbally abuse her like that,medium,medium

A weird post or situation I rly need your help now P S This is for a friend of mine he s eating my head over this and wanted some advice so thought I d ask the more experienced crowd over here Great now let s get to the post So a friend of mine started to rly like this girl who lives across the world from him told me about hrs from where he lives in TZ terms but rly wants to confess to her idk why since I know he s getting rejected anyway based on his description of her and his personality Also fun fact he did tell me they ve not even had a video call until now apparently she s kinda scared abt it as far as he told me So he took it to the levels where he did write an entire essay worthy proposal letter and asked me to rate it I have no idea about such stuff so thought I could give him advice from other people with much better advice than I could give So just give any advice on whether this pseudo proposal I m pasting below is any worth P S read the thing and apparently she s already in a relationship but he still wants to try so ig that exists Hey idk why I m posting this at this time of the hour but I really want to get this off my chest before it starts to mess around my head and I die of an anxiety attack I ve probably said this about a million times in this convo of ours but ever since this started I ve probably never felt better in my life in terms of emotional state and never expected a random DM of appreciation could go such a long way in terms of having a good social relationship But I think I m starting to like you a lot Now I can t justify anything I could do for you over your bf who you ve probably known for well over a couple of years instead of trusting a dude over the internet you met pretty recently but all I can say is that what I say comes from the bottom of my heart We might be polar opposites in every aspect of our lives from food likings to music to pretty much anything But you know what I m fine with that I could enjoy anything as long as someone close to I endear loves it too and takes a personal interest in it I m ok in having petty fights over such silly stuff as long as we don t take it too seriously Does help with having social contact in my opinion but it s kinda what kept me here for so long I really don t even expect you to agree to any of this at this point I kinda have come to terms with being solo in my life but you know what I kinda want to keep talking to you Irdk why I would ve ever said that but turns out it is kinda true Maybe it s just my kinda toxic relationship with people and where I was taken for granted But just this simple talking is all that I rly love about us I rly can t ever say I can treat you like a princess like most girls expect but I guess I could do something which might be one better have one loyal subject always at your service or help and do whatever I could for you But hey I just wanted to say this and I rly don t mind getting friend zoned at this point but I still want to keep talking to you Sry if I have ever done anything wrong in the past but I just wanted to say this I rly do like and love you Just hope we could keep this forever and at a more personal level I rly don t force you to any of this but just don t walk away from my life after giving me so much hope to live life to the fullest again P S I had to format what he sent had sent it in a single paragraph so had to format it a bit So it took a bit of effort so pls do read the entire thing and give your judgement Just tell how you would respond to it or how you would improve it while sending the message over He s sending this in text form so I do feel sorry for whoever is on the other side but I kinda feel that he s sincere about it Thanks in advance If he does allow me I ll probably post up the response if he allows me to in a follow up post but might take around few days he s not immediately giving this in,medium,high
Just When I Think I m In The Clear I was so sure I was over this But goodness this new bout I slammed into is by far the worst I ve felt in a long time I understand we re all trapped in our own heads but I ve never felt so tethered down like I have by this awful sickly feeling that has been plaguing my thinking nonstop the past five days I know I know nobody should get so upset as to contemplate suicide over a girl or guy not taking an interest in them but dang I m not one to feel so strongly about a potential relationship often At all So when I do and I know I m not doing well it feels like I m missing an incredibly important game changer for my life Yet here I am again Plastering this girl with my anxieties as I try to approach her about anything And this one going wrong is just another lump Another screw up in a long line of nothing but screw ups for me Another nail in the coffin as it were And it s not fair to her or anyone else who is subjected to my behavior I feel like I was just settling into great work relationships with these people at my new job and then I go out and get drunk with them a few times and tell them all about this girl and my anxieties And yesterday at work when I tried to joke and talk to the girl holy crap I m an idiot And a creep Then there is this other girl I really respect who is roughly the same age my sister would be had she not died years ago and during one of our drunken conversations she told me how I was like a little brother to her Of course this makes my heart swell with pure joy but then I wonder how creepy does that make me I m just a weirdo who pushes away people who genuinely try to care about me by getting too clingy The past two nights I d go out drinking and just tell myself aloud unfortunately how it would be best for me to just get this whole load of crap over with It upsets my friends who were drinking with me They genuinely do care but I can tell this attitude I have is weighing on them lately too Who can blame them It s terrible And the more I think about it the worse I get And the worse I get the more I think about it My descent into pure unadulterated self hatred is nearly complete All of this boils down to one question Am I ever gonna be good enough It just doesn t seem like the case Anytime I get a good opportunity thrown my way I don t know how to handle it I ve failed to adapt to society and the world Some people are still crazy enough to care about me for some reason though probably mostly thanks to biology but I ve been slowly pushing away my family in addition to my friends and coworkers This is nobody s fault but mine I know that I just don t want to hurt anyone I d rather not put my parents through losing another child But once I ve got a safe enough distance between my family and me I may genuinely consider checking out It s definitely become a legitimate daily consideration again,high,high
Need some help in MS LA I m male and I live around the Mississippi Lousiana border near Slidell and I don t know what to do really To start off I ve had minor depression issues on and off for years but this year it culminated in me actually needing to get meds to help control it same with anxiety I ve been on the meds for months and I m in worse shape than in January Recently it s become amplified infinitely due to my wife out of the blue wanting to split up due to a few mishaps in our relationship over the years I was completely blindsided by this and she refuses to talk it over do couples therapy I m addicted to her and we ve been together since mid before I turned and we have kids together who live with us were adopted out early on in our relationship Due to all this I ve been at wits end considering downing every bottle of pills I can find and even had the cops and e squad called on me earlier this week and I lied to them about me bordering on taking all the pills or not I don t even want to be in this shape due to my kids It pains me enough just to sit alone bawling my eyes out and having to tell my kids to give me a few minutes I saw a counselor on Monday and she said that I need to work on myself and throughout my life I ve been told I m too self centered so I have a hard time even doing things for myself anymore and for psychiatric help I was told the two closest places earliest I could get in would be three and five months I ve been teetering on self committment but I m worried that something like that could be leveraged against me to keep me from seeing my kids in the future Does anyone know of any psychiatric facilities that won t have me waiting a large portion of a year to be seen,medium,high

I think I just made suicidal gesture Okay So I m in grad school and it really sucks I m really not into the idea of going into academia but I don t want to quit I love my discipline and let s be real I have nothing else going for me That said I can t stand my peers or the faculty I feel like an idiot most of the time and I cannot get excited about the prospect of taking this any further given the cost I got into a language program that would be great for my CV but financially speaking I just can t afford to support myself through the summer Outside of loans I m on a shoe string budget as it is and this would ruin what little of my own money I have left I tell my adviser this and she tells me in so many words that if I don t do this I will not get my degree My adviser has been really absent through the degree process and hearing this is really disillusioning I have no clue what to do I don t want to give up my degree but I really really HATE my program If I stay I ll be miserable if I go I ll hate myself for quitting I know what your thinking but transferring in grad school is easier said than done Last night I got into a really big argument with my parents It wasn t so much about what decision I was going to make and more about the fact that I need to lighten the fuck up and take responsibility for myself A few hours later after I got done studying I was really upset I was thinking that I had made an irreparable mess out of this situation and that there was no way out of it So I took my belt off fastened it around my neck tied it to a rack in my closet not one high enough off the ground to hang myself and just sat there I considered tightening the belt enough to try to cut off circulation to my head but either I didn t think it would work or I chickened out I don t really know which it was I took it off and just went to bed So I guess my question is did I just make a suicidal gesture and what should I do about it I don t want my parents to worry about me I don t want to deal the embarassment of any potential fallout from telling anyone about the situation But I also don t think this is something I should brush under the rug,high,high

Feels like I have nothing to live for anymore I feel dead already The only thing that s stopping me is the fact that it s going to hurt and that I may have potential to survive this all until the end and live a good life with somebody who loves cares for me I highly doubt that though My mother has verbally abused me and almost physically since I was a young teen about years old Ever since I was that age she has been constantly talking about financial issues my Dad our broken family negative complaints about herself hating life and other bad toxic things basically manipulating my train of thought all this time and self esteem I feel like an alien among other people my age because I have grown up so sheltered and uneducated I feel like I m wasting my time and there s nothing out there for me I hate my family I think they re all disgusting people I hate my parents especially my mother I have like one friend and I most often hate her because she s younger than me and we don t match as people anymore then one other friend I sleep with of whom will probably drop me due to my boring life and lack of care for things these days amp x B I literally feel like this year is it for me I m a burden and I ve been told all I m good for is child support because I m a dependent and my mother just wants the money I wonder if I killed myself if she d even get anything anymore amp x B I don t know what I m saying I guess I just want to die I am so bored with this life I wish I was dead already,high,high

Irreversible problemIn general I ve had an alright life I ve got friends I m generally liked by those who take the time to get to know me I have a supportive mother and family I became successful in a career I wanted to pursue from just my own enthusiasm fincally alright off and I had a loving caring and stunningly beautiful girlfriend who I shared so much in common and wanted to spend my life with as did she Everything changed when my girlfriend took her life During our two year relationship she d been suffering from Borderline Personality Disorder I tried to get her support and help and in ways she seemed to be getting better The problems certainly put a strain on our relationship and left me emotionally and mentally exhausted at times but I stuck by her because she was worth it Among the many reasons she may have taken her life I know she was very scared about me being away for a new contract as I d been gone for the weekdays and even with me trying to reassure her I believe her abandonment issues overwhelmed her Since it happened everything has just spiralled Her mother blamed me and started to spread lies about me resulting in people turning against me It s put immense strain on my relationship with my mother as she witnesses me lose my will to live I had to leave the job as I could no longer face it and lost all passion for the career I once enjoyed so much The main thing above all else is how I ve lost her and I can t fathom or face a life without her She was just too special too loving too beautiful and no one will ever live up to her I feel like I failed her by moving away and none of this would ve happened had I just stayed I m I ve spent most of my adult life single due to my crippling shyness and anxeity It was almost a mircale that a girl like her was interested in a guy like me and I feel in ways I blew it for not making her feel more special and taking her for granted It s been over half a year since it happened and I m just getting worse Even with therapy grief counselling medication and endless research I m not improving I won t meet another and even if somehow I did they would never compare I don t really want to die but again I can t face a reality without her I find myself spending more time now just getting ready to end it getting the confidence to do it I get no joy from anything I just cry and spend all day in bed Not even sure why posting this I guess it s just somewhere to vent,medium,high

am I the cause of my own demise Never posted on here before and I m not sure why I feel the urge to now I used to cut myself all the time in my head I did it for attention I wanted people to notice and ask me if I was okay so I could say that I wasn t and they safely tuck me away in a hospital for crazies and the doctors would spend months trying unsuccessfully to break through my emptiness The reality was that I was so scared of people seeing my cuts that I hid them the best I could despite having hundreds at any one time my family had no idea until I flipped out at school I was sitting in some stupid class I think we had a relief teacher it was a class where you could sit and talk with your friends and do nothing and the teacher wandered around doing sweet fuck all I don t know why but I grabbed a Stanley knife and sliced into my arm multiple times I remember it stinging so bad because there were so many lighter cuts underneath them I laughed I felt like I had something to prove A boy saw the blood and told the teacher she came over and I said he was lying but she wouldn t leave me alone so I pulled up my jumper sleeve and screamed at her to fuck off as I ran out I don t remember what happened next but my parents were told about it and I d left the school grounds The school councillor found me and for some reason I agreed to go with him to hospital He took me to be evaluated by a child shrink I barely said a word and I didn t look at him once I felt like I was in a trance the air around me felt so cold and heavy It was decided that I was perfectly sane and didn t need any sort of help what so ever The councillor took me home and my parents asked to see my cuts before never mentioning it ever again So anyway I continued to lead a destructive lifestyle most weekends were spent wiping myself out with a bottle of straight bourbon or vodka I hung out at local music gigs with my friends many of them much much older than myself I did things to the extreme because it made me popular not always in a good way I went out of my way to stand up for my behaviour so if someone in our extended friends circle thought I was a dick I d push and push until their close friends liked me and they d eventually give in and treat me nicely too Meanwhile I was a straight A student my parents worked a lot they didn t pay much attention to my schooling my grades weren t bad so they didn t give it a second thought In fact they saw me as being responsible I often babysat my little sisters one of them from when she was only a few months old I wouldn t abandon them or throw parties or anything but I did play horrible mind games with them and they d never tell because I d scared them into believing that was worse than whatever I d tricked them into thinking had happened was happening All of this stuff it was selfish I wanted to be the rebellious renegade cool kid but my parents and to a point my teachers were fed this bullshit goody two shoes image that they fell for This is how I got away with never doing my hometown handing in essays late wearing incorrect uniform everyday never doing exams never paying attention spending most of my time in the classroom yelling and laughing and making excuses Looking back I can honestly say that I am amazed at how much shit I got away with and that I finished school I found comfort in typing to a select few male friends for hours upon hours I often developed crushes on them but they never went much further than sex i was young and they were often in their early s One guy in particular sticks in my head not sexually or anything we never even went there back then in fact he broke his hand after punching a tree at his birthday party because he felt so bad that I was so attached to him at the time So that was my first real broken heart our friendship was awkward for a while and then I moved away and we have barely spoke since As a teenager I threw massive tantrums but I didnt realise the extent of them until the last few years when I discovered that I have black outs where I am in an uncontrollable rage I remember my parents holding me down at to check for track marks on my arms I must have been pretty psychotic for them to accuse me of being a junkie Teen angst I assumed but years on my episodes have only gotten worse This is already a stupidly long story I don t even tell this to my shrink so I ll summarise the rest quickly my family moved several hours away when I was in my second last year of school I hated my new school I felt so stupid and lost and uncomfortable I got pregnant had a secret abortion and never forgave myself I moved back and lived in a granny flat with one of my sisters Finished school but things just went ever the same I d discovered drugs Pills and speed My school friends didn t understand I moved back to the city near my parents The guy I got pregnant to had hung around and I was living with him until I realised I had only stayed with him because I was a mess after the baby thing he got abusive when I left him not wanting my parents to judge me or seem weak I kept living with my ex filing in my weekends with raves and a rebound guy One thing that did impact my life at this point was ghb considered a dirty scum drug I had a big crazy image to build to ensure I was popular in this new scene it was easy I had nothing to live for I hated myself for what I d done and the more I partied the less I had to stop and deal with the consequences I ended up in an ambulance times in weeks I passed out and woke up in some random guys bed with him fucking me I ran away and went back to the club I met a guy that loved going out too but knew I needed help so he wouldn t let me out of the house no matter how much I kicked and screamed We went out for a year but we were bad for each other we substituted ghb with speed and were still taking ghb when we could I spent destructive months after he left me in pieces My friends saw the tantrums one night male friends tried to stop me from hurting myself but I am stupidly strong in these rages and I managed to smash my head into the concrete several times until they let me go and then I ran and ran and don t remember the rest Ghb was ruining me again I met a guy from the rave scene I didn t think I was ready to leave my ex in the past but I decided to give it a chance So glad I did best thing that ever happened to me We moved in together after only a few weeks and years on were engaged I don t want to disclose the finger details in this time but I will say that whilst I m a better person we still give in to temptations just as often and I still have anger issues but until recently I hadn t wanted to hurt myself like I do right now My sister died a short time ago Overdose But on opiates It s not real to me it confuses me I can t make sense of it I don t want to deal with it I was diagnosed with ADHD anxiety disorders including mild OCD about a year ago Since my sister died my OCD is my way of coping things that used to be funny but necessary to me now physically hurt if I don t do them or if I do them wrong I can t help but think that my childhood desire to have people feel sorry for me paved the way to becoming that person Sometimes I wonder if it s just all in my head if I don t completely believe that I m sick how will I ever help myself When I get angry I often black out my partner tells me what happened each time I ve tried to jump out of his car at high speeds on a freeway drank bleach tried to grab a gun off a police officer hit my head so many times it s not funny taken pills blah blah right now it all seems like a good idea I feel so selfish It makes me feel worse,high,high

To everyone starting high school I know you probably hear this a lot but take that shit seriously Prioritize school above literally everything else because it determines your future and can mean life and death If you don t graduate you can quite possibly watch your entire life become a mess in less time than you can imagine Every little thing counts do your best at absolutely all of it ask for help if you need it and don t hesitate to be the best you can be The education system is absolutely fucked but unfortunately it s all we have and you need to get through it so you can move on to the rest of your life and keep going Don t let yourself get distracted I m not saying don t have fun high school can be the most fun time of your life but never get distracted from the fact that these very short years literally determine every second of your life afterwards,medium,medium

I can t tell anyone the real reason I m suicidal I was recently put in a psych ward for the suicidal because I was stupidly dropping major hints that I planned to kill my self in hopes that I could ask for help without destroying my pride When I was put in there my family blamed it on Prozac seeing as one of its side effects is suicidal thoughts I ve talked to therapist after therapist and I told them all the same thing But I haven t told anyone why I really wanted to kill myself Not even my closest friends The real reason I wanted to die was because of a girl I know it sounds stupid but hear me out I had known this girl for years and have had a HUGE crush on her from the second I was introduced to her Many years went by she had moved back and forth a few times When she came back this time I confessed my feelings for her She said the feelings were mutual but she wasn t ready for a relationship yet seeing as she had just gotten out of a bad relationship I made sure to let her know that I understood and planned to respect that About a month goes by and she is very flirty with me Touching me writing me little notes making fun of eachother sending me hearts etc However just when I think I m getting somewhere she gets back together with her ex They were all over eachother Their social media s filled with posts about eachother and going on and on about eachother The works Now not only was I fucked sideways in this situation but she still keeps me just close enough so that these feelings can t go away And she still does all the flirty things she did when she was single She is the only girl I ve ever had feelings this strong for I can t help but love her But after a month and a half of this It didn t sting as bad it just made me very depressed and sick I was starting to get over my suicidal feelings The psych ward really helped me realize a lot However all of those feelings rushed back after we hung out We grabbed a pizza watched a movie made eachother laugh and went for a walk in the autumn leaves She looked absolutely amazing She made me happy The entire time I was with her I didn t have a single worry Nothing else mattered It felt like I was in heaven It was then I realized how much I actually love her She told me she loved me but it felt so hollow as if it barely meant anything to her I just felt so empty knowing how disposable I am We talk often and she says she considers me her best friend I obviously play along but she means far more to me than any friend ever has We talk almost every day we hangout at least once a week and she still acts as flirty as she used to but I know it ll never go anywhere It s sad to say but I put all my eggs in one basket and somebody stole it I know I sound really pathetic but that s why I lied to everyone I m ashamed that she is the reason I wanted to end my life Don t get it wrong I have a life outside of her I have friends and family and hobbies and things to be proud of but it feels like none of that matters without her I m truly a piece of shit but I guess that s why I m saying this to strangers on the internet,high,high

The time I almost got fired for pretending Garfield s favorite food was Spaghetti I originally wrote this in the comments of this post https www reddit com r confessions comments jwulcn anytime garfield comes up in conversation i felt it deserved to be posted properly i used to work at an ice cream shop near a plaza and some docks my boss was from communist romania he loved to remind us he had come here and established his own business i was one of maybe six employees and was fifteen at the time the work was pretty awful the actual shop part was a breeze but once a week we had to unload a wheeler full of frozen duffle bags full of ice cream boxes only half of which had handles id guess the bags were maybe pounds each that s awful already considering im a teenage girl but the truck was also like and it was usually like outside so id go into the truck throw the bags into the back of a pickup and then get out and sit in the back while the driver took us about minutes away to the walk in freezer during that drive i d sweat but once we got to the freezer the sweat would freeze then melt on the way back then freeze in the truck then melt again i used to have icesicles coming off of my hat and ponytail the whole truck would take maybe hours with four of us we didnt always get four and we had to empty the bags and sort the boxes in the freezer with almost no light so yeah maybe the worst job ive ever had To be clear I definitely don t hate the guy man was one of the friendliest people I ve ever met but maybe he shouldn t have hired a teenager to help handle the really difficult parts of his business I mention all of this because context is very important here He used to sit in the back for the first half of the day doing computer shit criticizing us throwing things if we cursed near customers and during his lunch break he would eat a ham and mustard sandwich while reading the comic strip section in the newspaper and laughing like santa claus but his mouth was ALWAYS full after he left and we went into the office to grab the keys you could see the wall he faced that had pictures of his family on it just covered in yellow mustard spittle like a shotgun spread anyway if one of us walked past him during that window to take the trash out or go on break or something he would always pull us aside and point at it laughing usually saying the punchline that got him There was of course one glorious exception BAAHAHA THE GARFIELD CAT He NEVER pointed out the punchline I think he just liked how he looked or something He did say HE HATES ZE MONDAYS sometimes too but mostly he d just roar out GARFIELD CAT and lose his mind choking on his sandwich sometimes Anyway this time I had JUST gotten in from like six hours of grueling ice cream truck freezer dufflebag HELL and as soon as I walked through the door he GRABBED my shirt and pulled me down laughing splattering mustard in my face laughing about garfield Now at this point I was just about fucking done His breath stank I was sweating and shivering not to mention this was all for minimum wage I had done the garfield bit twice before but not so die hard I d fuck with them for a minute or two then burst out laughing This time it was WAR I burst out laughing too instantly winning me an oscar and returned volley AHAHAA the SPAGHETTI CAT He stopped in PLACE No more laughing no more mustard He turned to me genuinely shocked at my misunderstanding You not mean the Lasagna he asked I shook my head looking at him quizzically instantly snagging my second oscar No no Garfield s favorite food is definitely spaghetti He grumbled about it searched the paper but that strip didn t mention it The next day I came into work though he was VERY quick to grab me again pretty much YANK me over to the desk and point out that TODAY S paper had a picture of the lasagna that Garfield was eating unfortunately for him it did not have the word lasagna written I claimed it was spaghetti he was very visibly frustrated but then we had a rush and he let me go The next day same deal but this time it had it written I had the balls to just laugh and say Wow this is a really elaborate joke you re pulling on me and he went BALLISTIC NO the PAPER SAYS LAH ZAGG NAH NOT SPAH GET EE He was very adamant about it for the rest of the shift not even caring that customers were there but I acted TOTALLY unfazed by it I d scoop their cones and checkout all while he trailed me like HOW CAN YOU THINK THE GARFIELD CAT EAT SPAGHETTI THERE IS NO NOODLE and I d reply with some total BS and confuse frustrate him even more I finally broke near the end of the day HE STAYED LONGER TO TALK ABOUT THIS WITH ME when he whispered to himself Does poor girl not know difference Her mother I just couldn t take it I laughed for like two seconds but he caught on I think his phrasing was YOU YOU HAVE BEEN A TRICKING ME and he started bellowing about it again We both fuckin cried about that for maybe an hour and we closed early Before I left he said I was Very funny girl but I was lucky he found out it was a joke because he was losing sleep over it and he couldn t handle working with me I laughed again and we said goodbye I got a new job a few months later with much better pay and less manual labor and he bought me some spaghetti from the pizzeria across the street as a parting gift on my last shift labeled lasagna Jesus that s a long post but it s one of my favorite stories glad to have it catalogued somewhere Hope you guys enjoyed reading haha,medium,medium

reasons not to quit struggling with thoughts ok i usually hate these sorts of things posting complaining and whatnot but i don t have anyone to speak to irl about these kinds of thoughts its been building and building over the past few months the feeling of just complete boredom with life i can t get excited about anything i don t care about finding love or going out or doing well at university or getting a job i don t give a crap about any of it i don t have enough motivation or perseverance for the trials and tribulations of life even if putting in effort would mean i could find those little pockets of happiness and meaning in llife to me it is way too much effort i m not happy with being and doing nothing but i don t care enough about life to change i don t know what to do anymore i can t make myself excited about anything i feel dulled i ve been on antidepressants for a while now but they don t help with the empty feelings which are the main reason for the suicidal thoughts I just can t see myself ever getting the will to make life interesting so why bother with life atall i m biding my time until i die so it seems logical to get it over with now i don t know what do anymore the thoughts are becoming more and more frequent and i m sick of trying to convince myself that something amazing is out there for me when it feels like a complete lie anyone out there feeling similar how do you cope any words of wisdom advice would be appreciated,high,high

I am not sure what I expect out of sharing this Anytime I have reached out in a moment of deep despair to our community through the various subs all the beautiful people rush forward and try to help which I appreciate immensely However even if I am alleviated of the pain of my existential issues the issues themselves remain So I have found myself in a moment with less emotional intensity and may be better equipped to rationally examine this I have been VERY careful not to discuss this with most people because I fear disrupting their foundation upon which all the good things rest ideals dreams goals etc If I am to progress past this low point in my life I absolutely need to approach the issue from all angles here I am not great with structuring these things sometimes so please forgive me Of all the lingering elements from my past that still bother me the foremost amongst these is my endless source of self loathing and my issues being invested in this world in this life While discovering I was trans finally gave me what I needed for decades the knowledge of what I am everyone is aware that it can get worse before it gets better I rode most of these waves rather well I believe considering all that has to be unpacked disposed off and the healing that must occur But I think these two things I mentioned keep coming back to bother me How can I stop hating myself if I even should I have felt this and fed this since middle school about twenty years ago While life has occasionally distracted me from this omnipresent fact this is part of the poison that seeps into the well I have tried creating positive feedback loops with proper self talk and productivity revising my mental narrative and outright ignoring those thoughts and feelings and focusing elsewhere I have seen therapists and I am familiar with their tools But this is DEEP and implacable Next as with many of us on this path I managed to survive by escaping this world For me that meant graphic novels standard novels gaming and eventually substances Some people think I am strong but I only managed to endure by being mindful of putting one foot in front of the other while dreaming of other worlds of another life Now even when I try I struggle to engage with this life And by that I mean to really feel invested to DESIRE to work on something and improve something to have the hope of any success I have always felt like I have been a person that just was not there Warning for others that are older harsh thoughts for my age ahead All of this is exacerbated by getting older Its a feeling like waking up from a coma in a house that is literally falling apart around me Having to struggle to get my life on track fighting with the momentum it has taken on and maintaining without any hope of actually improving really my body and appearance is just devastating I was better of not caring at all Who is out there for me What is there at all at this point Acceptance Surrender Just making it through and surviving Those sound like compensation prizes like an achievement worth little to no value I have focused on goals ran upon the hedonic treadmill and behind every thought is why My moment basking in the warmth of my trans epiphany has faded and I am left with the harsh reality of picking up whatever pieces I can find and seeing their value And for me I see none I am weak I am afraid and I am a burden to my family and friends I have broken hearts when I was lost and made so many mistakes I just want rest please I just want to not be me anymore I do not think kind sentiments will do much anymore Thank you for reading Lilith,medium,medium
I just want her back Me and my ex girlfriend had been going out for over a year I loved her more than anything and to be honest I still do She was my whole life we did everything together we went out pretty much every night and every weekend She was my only friend We broke up because she constantly lied to me she didn t show up when we planned to go out the day after I tried to kill myself She didn t come to school for over two weeks and she went out with her friend who she promised she would stay away from as she keeps trying to make her take drugs It got to the point where on the night I broke with her I flipped a coin if it were heads I would break up with her and if it were tails I would kill myself Thankfully it was heads but I m getting back to that stage again At school I have no friends anymore when I try to approach anyone to try to become friends with them they just tell me to fuck off or something like that so at lunch I just wonder about on my own and everyone just points and laughs at me I can t even try to be friends with my ex because she can t even look at me and she won t tell me why It s eating me up I can t live like this anymore I just want to wrap my arms around her and never let go She is so intelligent and beautiful She is the most amazing girl I have ever met Now she has started to walk around with the friend who I mentioned before that friend made my life hell for months she is the reason why I have cut myself on many occasions she also told her My ex to kill herself constantly to the point where she was about to I just want her back I can t live without her anymore If she doesn t even say hello to me by next Friday I m just going to go and hang myself because I can t take it anymore,high,high

Here s my rant about being miserable and depressed It helps to write it out even if it makes me cry more Basically everyone but my boyfriend and parents think I m pretty much fine including my professors school friends My boyfriend knows I m extremely depressed and suicidal and my parents know I m as bad as I was when I was which implies the same My therapist probably knows I m suicidal but I promised myself years ago when it was this bad before I d never go to a mental hospital again voluntarily because it s extremely traumatic for me I stopped seeing her because I don t want her to involuntarily commit me Specifically going between now and early January is an over my dead body type option because I ve been procrastinating grad school applications and need to finish them all by early January Going to the mental hospital literally rips away my support system and coping mechanisms completely such as talking to my boyfriend going on Reddit playing video games listening to people on discord sleeping as much as I want eating food I like etc The hospital also makes it so I might not be able to graduate from college on time or get bad grades which would mean I d have to reapply to graduate programs which would be enough to make me actually do it I m a good student and have a and a in my major which is great I have a really competitive internship in my field of study lined up for the spring in addition to my prior related work experience I love my field and feel like I m actually helping people My professors love me and almost all of them are willing to give me a letter of recommendation for grad school which is great The problem is no one would fucking believe that I m constantly suicidal and taking a semester off isn t an option I have a disability hearing or whatever it s called in March I m scared it s going to come out that I m very suicidal and I ll be sent off to the hospital again Like I m in a catch be re traumatized and potentially have to go to the hospital again and not graduate on time or have them not understand the gravity of the situation The guy who s the judge clearly doesn t get mental health stuff in my opinion based on previous times I ve talked with him It s like either go full NEET be hospitalized not regulate myself and they take me seriously or try to make a future for myself and be less suicidal and they don t take me seriously at all Being able to hold down easy credits of coursework that requires maybe hours of work a day and hrs a week internship isn t the same as being able to hold down a hour a week job My boyfriend is fucking incredible and the most supportive person aside from my parents I ve ever met I can t imagine life without him The problem is I feel so utterly inadequate because he has a physical disability that makes it so I have to do a lot of the chores like taking out the trash doing dishes etc yet I have fucking meltdowns that I can t control like crying fits if I m asked to do almost anything most of the time I get so short with him and lose it over tint stuff because I m so constantly miserable It s not intentional at all and I love him so much and do my best to be supportive of him I m so afraid of losing him yet I can t fucking control myself He can work and stuff thankfully at least and works in a well paying industry that he is really talented at I ve probably gained lbs in years easily from depression eating I went from pretty toned hourglass shape lifting weights x a week and walking tons around lbs at and about a size to now maybe a size x and lbs I m covered in unappealing stretch marks I haven t brushed my hair in a month or two so it s extremely tangled and knotted I struggle to brush my teeth I wear dirty clothes for weeks at a time I shower maybe once every three weeks I wish I was kidding I have very little interest in sex or anything like that but I try to at least once a week initiate something with my boyfriend because I don t want him to leave me He basically says it s not necessary to do this but I just don t want him to leave me I have a lot of weed because I m in a legal state temporarily and it s one of the only things that helps I don t take other medication because since covid I literally can t remember to especially not twice a day Also the old medication made me have shitty side effects like being difficult to orgasm sleep hrs a day made me extremely nauseous and didn t really help that much with my mood I ve tried basically every medication in the book I have a really weird case and rarely get concrete diagnoses I think I have bipolar and borderline personality disorder if I had to guess after being a former psych major for a while plus the diagnosis I ve heard from former psychiatrists But I ve also been encouraged to be tested for autism by a psychiatrist which I also think could explain a ton That s basically how I ve been doing It kinda helped a little to write out my feelings so thank

Well Here is my story I have been suffering from depression for years now All starting along time ago when at the ripe young age of my mom was diagnosed with cancer It was hard on me My father has a long hours job Always has Honestly I barely know the guy He did not really raise me I only ever say him hours a day in my entire childhood My brother and only sibling was physically and emotionally abusive through my childhood There is a hole the drywall where he decided to throw me into it once Once my mother passed away when I was I started failing miserably in school I dropped out of high school credit short of graduation Failed miserably at adult learning because of lack of motivation focus I was also bullied my entire childhood I have never had more then friends All of whom have become distant due to university college Shortly after my mothers death I had a psych breakdown from people bullying me about my dead mother I was admitted for a day of observation and they deemed me mentally stable Nothing was ever done about the bullies or my brother No matter who I went too My brother was just being bashful or playful and the occasional suspension was handed out to bullies but that really just delayed it for days before they came back Never had a girlfriend Iv managed to drown most of my sorrow in playing computer games rather then drugs I sought help once about a year and a half ago However my father brushed off my request for about months I felt better after talking to a psychiatrist However problematically it costs my father a session My GP also put me on some happy pills which helped for awhile but eventually in them self made me feel depressed in the only way I could be Happy was taking pills The financial burden of professional help is not something I am willing to place on my father So now I am not getting help Or taking drugs Back to square one of being miserable This has also adversly effected my lifestyle I eat between and meals a day Sleep no more then hours Finally I have begun to consider suicide as a way out I dont know Thats my jumbled mess of life experience thoughts and reasonings,high,high

Not SureI m going to try to be brief with this because I m gonna go to bed soon What do you do when you re uncertain about suicide I m sure a lot of us feel that way I know I do Like you think about ending it all but you don t exactly want to However you don t want to put up with the pain anger sadness anxiety and frustration that life throws at us I ve been feeling like that frequently Being in a spot where you can t change anything is really getting to me The main problem is my family and a lot things changed in the past few years I have different feelings towards some of the people I used to love and I constantly worry and fear the future The thing is I don t want to let anybody down especially my mom I m the youngest of three sisters and it ll most likely leave her heartbroken if I committed suicide I definitely don t want my mom to suffer because of me Then everything will be my fault if I left Can anyone relate to this feeling It s a tough decision I want to disappear sometimes but I m not sure if I can do it I ll be in January and I ve got a ton in front of me I m still learning and growing up yet intrusive thoughts get in the way of everything What should I do about this I am seeing a therapist in case you re wondering But I wonder about suicide and cutting myself,high,high

DoubtI have an invisible illness or at least that s what I ve been told Chronic Lyme disease It s been diagnosed and I ve been undergoing treatment on it for the last two to three years But there s always this doubt in the back of my mind I can t help but wonder what if it s all in my head What if I made this all up and it spiraled out of control until I truly started to believe it As a child I felt guilty seeing all these doctors I worried that I was making a big deal out of nothing that it was normal to feel this lethargic every second of every day It took me so long to get a diagnosis and even then half of the medical community vehemently deny the existence of the disease in general I don t know I can t figure it out and this guilty feeling of hopelessness is eating away at me I feel like nothing will ever improve and I should just get this pain over with and end my freaking life already I m not going to accomplish anything I ll always be a burden to my family there s no hope left for me My life has been wasted and it might as well be my own fault,medium,medium

Not sure what to do My life feels like it s over Hi I was just directed to this sub I m not even sure where to begin I have mental problems memory issues so if there is a timeline discrepancy or everything is mixed up I m sorry I m also sorry for the length of the post You dont have to read it it s OK I m and have lived an incredibly dismal life As a child I lived with a single mom she had me when she was eighteen She had no aspirations and not much of an education So we lived with her parents off and on until she was over thirty Which was alright except that my grandfather never took it up to be the male role model in my life He was extremely cynical of me and would make me cry pretty well daily And for some reason I d cry until I vomited which I believe contributed to my future stomach problems It sucks pretty bad when you re eight years old and your own family won t believe you have heatburn It s like leaving me there to bleed out I was very thankful of this when I vomited blood up for the first time due to the burning in my stomach By the time I was in grade two I was removed from my school due to behavioral issues and placed in a special class for misbehaved students This was also in a catholic school It was an extremely hostile environment and putting problem kids in a class full of problem kids is probably the worst idea I ve ever heard But it s still happening to this day and damaging the lives of countless children The lax learn at your own pace philosophy they seem to have held probably wasn t very beneficial to a lot of the students The only thing that pushed you to the next grade was to simply be there There were no tests to pass no work to be graded on You didn t even have to do anything In grade five we moved from the big city to a super small town they didn t have behavioral classes but I made so many friends and things were happy the days were bright Six months later we moved to another small town because my mom met some guy We moved in with him I made more friends everything was OK I went to school there were no problems They didn t have behavioral programs for students in these places in the country it seems we moved from toronto to new brunswick to nova scotia,medium,high

"I started seeing my pdoc in fall of 2012. Around this time, I went into the hospital for suicidal ideation. Little medication change, things were pretty good until spring of 2014. I relapsed hard, purging, cutting, not going to classes. 
 My therapist asked me to start coming in 2x a week, which didn't help and just cost me a ton of money. My pdoc upped me to the maximum dosage of my antidepressant. This really messed me up and I completely broke down and had to go home for the semester.
 I returned last fall, feeling much better after seeing a good therapist in my hometown and switching medications. I was doing pretty well. 
 But for the past month or so, I've been having symptoms that I've never really had before. I can hardly sleep, I can't focus (it takes me forever to read a news article) and I just feel anxious and overstimulated all the time. 
 I saw my pdoc this morning for a regular appointment, but made some of this new stuff clear on my intake sheet. He brushed it all off as stress (I'm working about 25 hours a week this semester.) 
 I feel like saying more would be pushy. I just think that after three years, he's not going to be open to looking into yet another diagnosis. It feels so stagnant. Our appointments are 10 minutes, tops.

intrusive thoughts i feel so desperate coming to reddit for advice but honestly anything helps ive been struggling with intrusive thoughts for like 5 years theyll come and go at more extremes usually if im anxious about a lot of things my intrusive thoughts will take over i have been in a committed loving relationship for over 6 years with the man i want to marry and grow old with i will also say that i am pretty much asexual i enjoy doing things with my boyfriend because of the love and trust we have built and i find him attractive but never anyone else and i dont really ever think about sex or anything i get really bad intrusive thoughts that ive cheated on my boyfriend though when i know its absolutely not true and goes against everything i believe an intrusive thought will happen and my brain will immediately try saying no thats stupid but its like my brain will fight itself and i have to prove its not real messages calls emails etc from that day on top of this i have a great memory i can remember times ive just waved to people but i only get intrusive thoughts months or years after i knew someone so also doesnt make any sense im extra freaked out because last night i was having intrusive thoughts and trying to move past it later on my boyfriend and i were having sex and i got an intrusive thought i pushed past but afterwards my brain connected the intrusive thought to what my boyfriend and i had done and freaked me out so bad i had a full on panic attack i never have graphic or intrusive thoughts with images so it scared me that i did it made it feel even more real im really struggling and feel like i cant go on like this anymore i dont want to lose the love of my life but this isnt fair to him i dont know how to go on i feel like my brain isnt a part of me and its killing me i feel like a zombie everyday just sitting in anxiety i never make male friends or really any friends unless my boyfriend knows them for over three years because of intrusive thoughts i can barely get new jobs because of the anxiety that i will get intrusive thoughts about the people i work with i am supposed to be going to school soon and the anxiety of being around people is terrible i get intrusive thoughts if i politely wave to someone i dont know in public it is consuming my entire being and i need help btw i am in therapy and have been for like three years,low,low

What the fuck did I just drink I was at a private party people I knew everyone there We bought some beers bottle of wiskey brandy and some energy drinks Later in the night we ran out of drinks and my friend s gf suggested she can bring out a bit of homemade stuff that her mom makes from her basement We agreed and she brought something that she claimed had alchohol It was like drinking fire but realy easy to down nice flavour and I didn t even need to drink something like cola to down it more easily Got me fucked up in few mins Realy strong clean alchohol high Me and my gf were the only ones who drank it she did shot and I did Next day I had visual audio and sensory halucionations on the bottomn corners of my FOV I saw realy detailed smoke every time I exhaled and when I closed my eyes I could hear my gf breathing in my face and even saying something just like in that moment when we drank this stuff I thought it was just me and didn t tell anyone but later I saw on my gf s insta story that she had absolutely same things going on smoke everywhere and she kept feeling my breath on her face I am realy weirded out Has anyone heared of a halucionations from alchohol We both were on alchohol nicotine caffeine and sleep deprived for h when this happened but real weird that we had the same effects Even today I can barely see a small haze on my FOV when I look for it What the fuck,medium,medium

"*it was about time i put my feelings into words. I am so sick and tired of feeling this way, feeling like i will never be happy, like my life is going to waste, like i will never amount to anything. I am tired of holding myself down from experiencing life while it slowly slips away, while i slowly slip away from within my own reach. its so draining seeing everyone openly be themselves, having fun and enjoying their youth while i sit here and watch mine deteriorate right in front of my eyes. I am so tired of seeing people advance in life while i watch motionless. when will it ever be my time???????? i ask myself every day. when will it ever not be this way???? i drive myself insane while people continue to flourish in pure sanity. i want to get out, walk the streets confidently without having to hide every aspect of myself and my life. i want to feel comfortable in my own skin, my own body, my own life in which i have been precociously shrouded. i want to be able to feel life, what it really means, instead to living lifelessly. i want to do as my peers do. i want to be able to fit in. i want to be one of them without having to hide anything. i wish i could just look people in the face without having to feel like i want to die while they look at mine. i want to show people me, the true me I have been hiding all my life........but i do not even like her, why do i expect them to like her......what is there to even like?? nothing. that is right nothing. no wonder why i have not let her out in years. no one would want to see her pathetic, ugly self. but she is still me though..she is the only one who is been with me through everything, she is the only person who truly knows me, she is seen my true colors, my unfiltered self, she knows every part of me and she continues to be here. she is seen me at my lowest and while she did not say anything good to comfort me, i felt her presence...at least i was not completely alone after all. i hate her so much but without her i would not have survived.....but is that even a good thing?? it would have been better if i did not anyways. i have nothing to live for. all this time, I have been chasing something that was not there. getting lost in a mirage of lies but i contiued to run regardless. running after something that is not written in my destiny. how pathetic. younger me was really pathetic wishing for happiness each day like her wishes were not just getting ignored and pushed to the side each time. she had hope. hope for something that will never happen.* idek",medium,high

"When I feel the emptiness, it’s like I’ve fallen into a hell void where I feel nothing at all except a deep anguish and desperate need for life to be over ASAP.

I feel utter despair. It feels like it will last forever and I can’t remember a time it wasn’t happening. I feel desperate and hopeless and helpless in the face of the pain. I can’t do a thing except smoke cigarettes and tell people over and over again that “I need to die. I can’t take this. It’s unbearable.” Does anyone else experience this? Does ANYTHING help you?

Anyone planning suicide in the long term future I m a depressed F who is considering suicide but not soon but within maybe years Why do I want to kill myself It s kind of a long story But the main reasons are a combination Lack of Economic Stability Health Problems Family along with a lack of purpose or inherent value of life Economic Growing up was hard and I ve had to overcome a lot of adversity lower income household mother dying at a young age being a queer person of color strict parents depression etc like a lot of people here I m in college currently but found that although I genuinely love learning and picked a STEM major college just seems very oppressive I know it makes me sound like an entitled first world millenial My parents made me go the flagship state school directly after high school not allowing me to choose a different school or even CC for a few years I had relatively good grades in high school I knew from the moment I was on campus that I hated it lack of diversity and friendship my health was negatively impacted I didn t have a good sense of direction or idea for a major career and never felt inspired I thought about transferring but didn t have the resources or finances first generation college student so I stuck it out though I was depressed I did well academically but since my major department is kinda shitty applied math I m worried that I won t get a good paying job unlike engineering students Like had I known earlier I would have just majored in that instead I will leave college next year with about K in loans Family Generally I strongly dislike my family life My other siblings went to medical school and basically left the house as fast as they could My mom died at a young age and instead of helping me out as possible with school or becoming self sufficient my dad remarried and spends his money on his new wife unemployed and kids even though he s pretty old and should be focusing on retirement I haven t come out as queer yet but worry that my family will disown me because of it not super religous but super conservative strict and family oriented My parents are also immigrants so we don t have tons of wealthy family here Health I have a lot of chronic probably genetically caused health diseases since I was young When I was young and in my mid teens I was able to take care of them when my parents were employed and supportive After my mom died my dad didn t bother helping me out that much and without the resources for seeing specialists anymore my health has decreased It s hard at college too because I don t have a car and I didn t always have health insurance to be able to see anyone So my health continues to decrease These aren t life threatening health issues but irreverisble for the most part and make me feel insecure and self conscious So because of all this I find it hard to justify continuing life I am kind of a nihilist and definitely an atheist with no absolutely no belief in the afterlife I don t want to kill myself yet but in years when I can be more distant from my family and meticulous in suicide planning once I m in the real world I ve seen many psychologists over the years but rarely find them helpful or knowledgeable and condescending even It seems statistically unlikely that a queer woman of color from a first generation college student background with severly limited family support chronic health issues and student loans to be economically secure in like even years And it s hard to see my straight white male friends from more accepting and upper middle class families succeed in life when it s a constant struggle for me And even if I can push through and somehow find a way through the misery what s the point Why suffer and struggle so much in life if I don t really see a reason too Basically I created this post to see if anyone else agreed with me and is truly planning suicide in the future I m also fine with talking to people about my choices and or expanding on the reasons above though I doubt people can change my mind TL DR Want to wait years before committing suicide Basically I personally see life worth living if I m economically secure have supportive family and friends and am generally healthy However for a multitude of complex reasons all of the above factors are not really possible or likely for me I am also a nihilist atheist and don t see a point to life other than that society has stigmatized suicide and thinks everybody born should continue living,high,high

Cold empty alone I m currently sitting in my room after a particularly horrible moment with my mother and don t know what else to do You probably already know what I want to do I don t even know why I m here Just turning to the one place I know Reddit Sorry for any mistakes my eyes are leaking I know no one cares about any type of backstory or even me but I guess I should give a bit more background to make myself seem a little less like the shitty teenager you ll think I am But first of all what sparked this particular fight if I can even call it that was I was just having a generally shitty day Felt nauseous all day for some reason my mother drove over a curb which caused the pizza we had just bought to spill onto my brand new white shirt plus my mom has just been rude all day to me to strangers It s just your typical annoying day I was annoyed and you could tell Wasn t really speaking much but when I did I was short with her and bitter This annoyed her and I knew that but I couldn t make myself cheery Right before our fight I was telling her about Juice WRLD and how sad it was I had already mentioned his passing earlier but I m a big fan of someone he had collaborated with didn t know they had collaborated until that moment and was explaining to her how they apparently collaborated During saying this she was nodding her head and acting like she was listening but apparently she wasn t She started coughing a few moments after I was finished speaking and said I was choking the entire time you were talking Thanks for noticing and caring Really means a lot Now if I had noticed she was choking I would ve immediately helped her I m not that horrible When speaking to her I was looking directly at her and she was nodding the entire time and didn t seem in distress whatsoever I was confused and told her this but she said she was making it obvious but couldn t tell me she was choking since she couldn t breathe and was coughing I pointed out she didn t cough until after I finished speaking but she just said I was wrong I let it go because I don t want to argue so I just go back to browsing Reddit She asked me now what did you say and I just told her to forget about it it didn t matter This is where everything went horribly She persisted come on tell me Now I ll admit I yelled at her Everything was boiling right under the surface and I just couldn t keep calm anymore She proceeds to tell me she heard me mention Juice WRLD and my favorite band but she didn t know why I told her then she must ve heard me This is when she decides to push my buttons She starts saying how I m just the happiest little girl she s ever met I m almost how I m a ray of sunshine and SUCH a good daughter and she s laughing this entire time I m ignoring her because she does this all the time looking for a reaction and I don t want to give her the satisfaction This is when she mentions how I need happy pills and she doesn t know what type of pills that would be but I need some kind of pill she didn t mean antidepressants This seemed incredibly insensitive to me as I was just speaking to her about Juice WRLD and of course so many people are thinking his death is caused from drug use She knew what she was doing I ll admit I said something really disgusting I said good maybe they ll kill me so I can finally die She s known about my suicidal thoughts since August of this year and didn t much care when she found out She actually found out because I had told my sister about some notes journal type things I had written to help me cope She confronted me like I was in trouble saying we need to talk and you know exactly what you ve done She didn t do anything except threaten me with making me go to a hospital and sent me to my room I ve brought it up one other time on Thanksgiving after a huge family fight saying May I had a handful of pills ready to go and didn t do it She made this about herself saying how she must be a terrible mother I just ignore it at this point After I said maybe the nonexistent happy pills she s speaking about would kill me she started going off She said I have no business acting like my life is so horrible how I have the easiest life in the world how other people my age have school jobs and even kids and how she doesn t make me do anything and hands me everything on a silver platter I ll get to why this really hurt me later But she just kept saying that I shouldn t act like she s the worst person in the world because she s the best mom I ve got she says this every single time me or my sibling is upset with her and I stayed silent the entire time I was crying but silent She knows why I struggle with living but doesn t care She dropped me off at our shared home and left She has actually came back home as I was writing this I m currently locked in a bathroom A big reason as to why I struggle with living is because of chronic illness For probably years I ve been sick I genuinely don t remember what it feels like to not feel pain It started with a rare condition which was causing me to vomit every day of my year old life and I started to lose my vision Took a year before they figured out what it was but i was on medication for a long time spinal taps every couple months before I finally had brain surgery in A few months after the surgery I had a fever every single day of August It took a while before they discovered what it was IBD Not many people without IBD know how much it sucks and I m sure my experience is unlike other people suffering with IBD but when I say my IBD has ruined my life I mean it I haven t been in remission once since fall I ve been close but there has always been something wrong My GI office that I stuck with from beginning to summer of this year also didn t help much as I found out I had been on medication I shouldn t have been steroids for years which has also made my life a living hell I have since been diagnosed with cushing s syndrome because of the steroid use I also have fibromyalgia osteopenia and gastroparesis Things were bad May since I had that handful of pills but that summer I was started on chemotherapy and it genuinely ruined my life I don t know if my reaction was normal but after a couple doses my days started blending together It s hard to describe but it felt like my average day was maybe an hour or two long During this time I felt absolutely zero emotion I felt nothing I just remember wishing I could feel again Crying and being upset hurts but being physically unable to feel nothing being completely and utterly numb is so much worse I really could not feel And I thought it would get better after I was off of it but I didn t for a long time I was so numb and so scared I m still not back to what I was before The only way I can describe how I feel is like I m in this super deep dark hole I m completely alone it s freezing cold and all my senses have been ripped from me All I feel is so scared I m always scared I have nightmares every single night about my worst fears and I have flashbacks about different procedures Sometimes I ll be sitting doing nothing and feel like a feeding tube is being forced down my nose I know it s not really happening but I get so scared A lot of traumatic things have happened to me and my doctors and mom make me feel like I m being a baby about it I ve never sought help for any of these mental issues because I know I won t be happy or okay til I m normal Not sick Not in pain For my mom to tell me I have the easiest life in the world really hurts I am in misery I keep trying to claw myself out of where I m at and recently I ve been happy Or I thought I was But last night I felt a little strange and then today this all happens and I realize I was never happy i was just trying to pretend I was I m exhausted I m tired I m having a hard time breathing and I just want it all to be over I don t want to be alive but I can t make myself kill myself I m a coward I pray every night that I won t wake up the next day so when I roll over and see the sun through my blinds see the posters on my walls and feel that I m still here I m upset The one thing I want won t happen unless I do it myself And I can t bring myself to do it no matter how hard I try What makes it so much worse is my grandmother dad s side called me while I was writing this She brought up how our entire family has been depressed and how she felt like she was in a fog She told me this while I m ranting about wanting to die How cruel is that Even worse my grandfather wanted to talk to me He is the only father figure I ve ever known the only man I ve ever trusted and loved and my light and purpose He is the only person to ever fully love me His love is unfaltering and he s always been here for me I had to give short responses because I was sobbing but I m really good at hiding it now so I don t think he noticed And then he told me he loves me so much and to please take care of myself He told me he loved me again I broke I think he might ve heard me but I don t know I needed that so badly but the worst part is it isn t changing my mind I still want to die How can I be so cruel and selfish That s disgusting of me I don t even know if I want to send this now But I just don t know what to do Want to die but can t do it Coward Don t really want help but here I am anyway I just want someone to acknowledge me and understand I want someone out there to understand why I want this and understand me I want someone to know I exist as well I don t have any friends and few family that speaks to me My mom is the only person that really talks to me I dropped out of high school a while ago because of teachers claiming I was faking my illnesses and I can t get a job because my immune system is so weak I ve had a cold for a month now And I am a complete loser I might sleep now Actually sleep not die Still too much of a coward to do that I doubt anyone will read this but it feels good to be able to put it all out there My head is busting and my eyes are so swollen I don t even much care really No where near as painful as my current thoughts I m sorry if you actually read this TL DR your basic

The only reason I have not killed myself is because I don t want to be selfish but I really want to do it For the past years I ve wanted to kill myself but I don t want to hurt the lives of others I know that if I killed myself I have friends and family that would be very upset and would wonder if there was anything they could have done to stop it So I guess it s good that I recognize that I have made some impact on others but that s not the issue here I just don t want to live I don t like life I know that if I were more optimistic I could maybe have a better life but I ve tried being optimistic and that doesn t work out either because I always end up disappointed I ve gotten to the point where I m just faking life I do what I need to do to fit in I know it s been five years ish since I ve felt this way but I m wondering if there will ever be a point that I just say screw it and do it I also attempted once about years ago when I first started having these thoughts and one of my close friends no longer close helped me out and stopped me from completing my already started actions So yeah I realize that other people would be disappointed But I want to do things for myself Well I guess by that I mean that I want to do this one thing for myself I hope that was coherent Your thoughts reactions would be appreciated,high,high
Today I may kill myself Some background I m years old in college I ve had depression pretty much my whole life but didn t get diagnosed until I was Spent two years in therapy before finally leaving home to continue college Things were going well until I had a relapse last year Everything started to spiral out of control and next thing I know I ve been forced to move three times failed to complete two semesters in a row and now failing just one month into this semester My therapist put me on a waiting list for occupational therapy but I won t be able to get any help for at least three months I have an assignment due tomorrow a midterm next week and I m lonely I have tried so many times to see the point in continuing but I feel I m done Nothing in life is enjoyable to me any more if it even was I can t bear the thought of going back home I hate my country with a passion None of my friends have the time for me and even the thought of my family doesn t take away the pain For several years I kept myself alive because I didn t want to hurt my family but I can t take it anymore I don t care they ll be upset it s not fair that I continue in this state just so they don t feel guilty I can t bring myself to tell anyone about any of this so I m leaving this here so someone will know have read my thoughts I m currently expecting a call from my therapist and depending on how that goes I m going to summon up what energy I have to end my life Currently lying in bed thinking about my options I have paring knife in the kitchen I plan to use I live alone so no one will know to come for me until my landlord comes to pick up the rent My other option if I can t overcome my fear of how much cutting will hurt is to take a bus downtown and jump off a bridge there Update My therapist called an hour ago I ll be seeing her tomorrow and she s trying to get another psychiatric evaluation for me,high,high

i feel truly hollow and aloneheya to those reading ive been here a few times awhile back in the past but i feel this time is different i should probably explain myself a bit in case people want to understand where im coming from My name is Macy im a transgender girl and recently ive kinda fell into a fucked up place and i dont think i can get through this one awhile back i ended up leaving my highschool because of my social anxiety bullying lack of motivation and some other things to appease my parents i got enrolled in a few online classes because i still legally need to be in a school at the age of fifteen but its basically dropped out at this point in my life ive been able to keep my social life alive since that happens awhile back but as with how the world works to a regular teenager friends change but this time with my old friends now gone i really have no one anymore but a few people online and my bed and the online friends arent really close to me either ive had some issues in the past with drugs coke acid weed cigs some others that i had under control for the most part but recently ive felt the urge that it might be my only way to cope with this pain i feel in me thats driving my sanity to the breaking point i understand im young and i probably dont know what im talking about at this point in my life but i know what i feel and it feels really terrible my now ex boyfriend hasnt spoken to me in over two weeks which has really strained my mentality because he was all i had left in terms of close people and i struggle with signs of some mental illnesses that make me really dependent and clingy i m not a fan of self diagnosing and my therapist said i can show signs but cant really have a disorder or etc until you re an adult but he said he would agree i show signs of the things i believe i might have ive found myself in a state of constant distraction to keep me from thinking of how alone and in pain i am but it only eats at me more i really dont know what to do anymore ive tried hotlines in the past but they didnt help and i keep getting the urge to die or do something drastic to make myself happy and then die in peace knowing i did what i wanted im sorry about the bad grammar im not really in the best of moods to proofread my rant about my depression,medium,medium

Why are people so quick to jump on the pro life wagon every time someone mentions suicide First response anytime suicide is mentioned is call a crisis line or get help or etc What really is so bad about taking one s life aside from potentially hurting family friends if you even have any Personally suicidal thoughts are the only thing that get me through the week I think to myself that I ll do it Saturday night and I just bide my time till then It makes me feel relieved inside to think about not having to deal with anything anymore Only thing stopping is me is being scared of actually doing it But as each weekend goes by I get closer to overcoming the fear So why can t other people especially strangers give their blessing when someone expresses their wish to die rather than try and talk them out of it right away,high,high

"Hi, this is may be deleted at one point but I’m not sure when
 
 I am not yet diagnosed with borderline but I’m almost 100% I have it. And it’s killing me. It has been killing me all my life. It has affected my friends, my loved ones and myself. But you probably already know that
 
 What’s concerning me right now, is whether or not I can feel love. Right now, my girlfriend and I are on a one week break from one another. I’ve been what I fee is an emotionally abusive asshole towards her. Paranoid that she would cheat on me, that she would leave me. And before that, ever little thing I didn’t like that she did, set me off. When it shouldn’t have, and I know it shouldn’t have. But it did anyways. And it always hurt me later to think about it.
 
 My question is: can borderlines feel love? I feel like I’ve been such a manipulative piece of crap to her, and I just want to know if there’s even any hope. I don’t want to hurt her heart, she means so much to me but I’ve been such a douche to her. I stared self reflecting so much, asking why I even love her. If I even do. I cried so much thinking about her gone. The thought of not seeing her. Her smile gone, her heart to someone else. She can do as she pleases but it hurts me. Do I love what she’s done for me, or her as a person? How can I even tell? Is she better off without me? Can I fix us? Maybe I’m overthinking..
 
 I’m just so lost right now and would like some experiences and thoughts and advice, even. It hurts my chest and makes me cry and I’m desperate",low,high
I want to die but I don t know how to approach and say goodbye to the girl I have feelings for I can t do this anymore I finally decided to give up I m no longer anxious to die It doesn t fear me anymore I dread waking up in the morning I completely lost my will to live I m a piece of garbage who can t stand seeing people be happy because my life gets shittier day by day This world doesn t need people like me and I m doing everyone a favour My final wish is to get one final glimpse of her beautiful face I don t care what people think about her she s beautiful and i ve always thought she is We ve been looking at each other for years through primary and all the way to middle school Not a single word we spoke to each other and it s my fault she tried to approach me multiple times but I ignored her because I was shy and anxious she probably hates me now I once eavesdropped her and it turns out she likes someone else She lives next block I don t know how to approach her confess everything and say goodbye She deserves better anyways,high,high
